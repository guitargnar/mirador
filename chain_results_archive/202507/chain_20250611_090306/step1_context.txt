**Post 2: Automating Vulnerability Reports**

Title: From manual to automated: How we saved hours with PowerShell scripts

"At Humana, I built a custom PowerShell script that automates the generation of weekly vulnerability reports. This not only saves us hours of manual work but also ensures consistency and accuracy.

The script uses APIs to fetch data from our systems, processes it in real-time, and generates a comprehensive report. We've seen a significant reduction in reporting time and an increase in the quality of our insights.
