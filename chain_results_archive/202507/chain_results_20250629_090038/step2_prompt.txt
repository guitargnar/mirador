Here is an analysis from a previous agent: 

**Day 1: Fundamentals of Sweep Picking**

* Warm-up (5 minutes):
	+ Finger stretches
	+ Chromatic scale in standard tuning
	+ Arpeggios in A minor
* Technique Focus:
	+ Learn the basic sweep picking motion with a metronome (start at 80 BPM)
	+ Practice sweeping between two notes (e.g., E to G) using a pick
	+ Focus on smooth, even transitions and consistent tone
* Exercise (15 minutes):
	+ Sweep picking exercise: e|---0---2---3---5---7---8---10---12---|
	+ Repeat this pattern 4 times, focusing on maintaining a steady rhythm
	+ Gradually increase the tempo to 120 BPM as you become more comfortable
* Theory Focus:
	+ Identify the scale degrees used in the sweep picking exercise (in this case, E major)
	+ Understand the concept of "target notes" and how they relate to the sweep picking motion

**Day 2: Rhythm Development**

* Warm-up (5 minutes):
	+ Finger stretches
	+ Basic groove exercises (e.g., playing a steady eighth-note rhythm on the low E string)
	+ Reviewing the chromatic scale in A minor
* Technique Focus:
	+ Develop your timing and coordination by practicing a simple 16th-note rhythm with sweep picking
	+ Emphasize the importance of even spacing between notes
	+ Experiment with varying the tempo to find a comfortable pace
* Exercise (15 minutes):
	+ Sweep picking exercise: e|---0---2---3---5---7---8---10---12---|
	+ Add in some rhythmic variation by introducing slight delays or skips (e.g., 16th-note rhythm with a slight delay on the "and" of beat 1)
* Theory Focus:
	+ Analyze the rhythmic patterns used in your favorite metal songs
	+ Identify common time signatures and understand how they relate to the music

**Day 3: Economy Picking**

* Warm-up (5 minutes):
	+ Finger stretches
	+ Basic arpeggios in A minor
	+ Reviewing the chromatic scale in A minor
* Technique Focus:
	+ Learn the basic economy picking motion with a metronome (start at 80 BPM)
	+ Practice picking individual strings in an arpeggio pattern (e.g., A minor: A-C-E-A-C-E)
	+ Emphasize the importance of smooth, even transitions and consistent tone
* Exercise (15 minutes):
	+ Economy picking exercise: e|---0---3---5---7---10---12---|
	+ Repeat this pattern 4 times, focusing on maintaining a steady rhythm
	+ Gradually increase the tempo to 120 BPM as you become more comfortable
* Theory Focus:
	+ Understand the concept of "target notes" and how they relate to economy picking
	+ Identify the scale degrees used in the exercise (in this case, A minor)

**Day 4: Sweep Picking with Chord Progressions**

* Warm-up (5 minutes):
	+ Finger stretches
	+ Basic chord progressions in A minor
	+ Reviewing the chromatic scale in A minor
* Technique Focus:
	+ Learn to sweep pick over a simple chord progression (e.g., Am - F - G - Em)
	+ Practice maintaining a steady rhythm and smooth transitions between notes
	+ Experiment with varying the tempo to find a comfortable pace
* Exercise (15 minutes):
	+ Sweep picking exercise: e|---0---2---3---5---7---8---10---12---|
	+ Add in some chord changes by introducing slight delays or skips (e.g., Am - F - G - Em with a slight delay on the "and" of beat 1)
* Theory Focus:
	+ Analyze the chord progressions used in your favorite metal songs
	+ Identify common chord voicings and understand how they relate to the music

**Day 5: Rhythm and Timing**

* Warm-up (5 minutes):
	+ Finger stretches
	+ Basic groove exercises (e.g., playing a steady eighth-note rhythm on the low E string)
	+ Reviewing the chromatic scale in A minor
* Technique Focus:
	+ Develop your timing and coordination by practicing a complex 16th-note rhythm with sweep picking
	+ Emphasize the importance of even spacing between notes and maintaining a consistent tempo
	+ Experiment with varying the tempo to find a comfortable pace
* Exercise (15 minutes):
	+ Sweep picking exercise: e|---0---2---3---5---7---8---10---12---|
	+ Add in some rhythmic variation by introducing subtle changes in timing (e.g., slight delays or skips)
* Theory Focus:
	+ Analyze the rhythmic patterns used in your favorite metal songs
	+ Identify common time signatures and understand how they relate to the music

**Day 6: Advanced Sweep Picking**

* Warm-up (5 minutes):
	+ Finger stretches
	+ Basic arpeggios in A minor
	+ Reviewing the chromatic scale in A minor
* Technique Focus:
	+ Learn advanced sweep picking techniques, such as:
		- Alternate picking with sweep picking
		- Legato sweep picking
		- Sweep picking with a pick and fingers (hybrid picking)
	+ Practice these techniques with a metronome (start at 80 BPM) and gradually increase the tempo to 120 BPM
* Exercise (15 minutes):
	+ Advanced sweep picking exercise: e|---0---2---3---5---7---8---10---12---|
	+ Repeat this pattern 4 times, focusing on maintaining a steady rhythm and smooth transitions between notes
* Theory Focus:
	+ Understand the concept of "target notes" and how they relate to advanced sweep picking techniques
	+ Identify the scale degrees used in the exercise (in this case, A minor)

**Day 7: Music Analysis**

* Warm-up (5 minutes):
	+ Finger stretches
	+ Basic chord progressions in A minor
	+ Reviewing the chromatic scale in A minor
* Technique Focus:
	+ Analyze a favorite metal song and identify the sweep picking patterns used
	+ Break down the techniques used to create the desired sound and rhythm
	+ Experiment with recreating the pattern on your own guitar
* Exercise (15 minutes):
	+ Analyze a new song and identify the sweep picking patterns used
	+ Create a tablature of the pattern and practice it using a metronome
* Theory Focus:
	+ Understand how the music is structured and how the sweep picking patterns fit into that structure
	+ Identify common musical elements, such as chord progressions and scales, and understand how they relate to the song

Note: Throughout the week, make sure to take breaks and stretch your hands and fingers. It's also essential to practice with a metronome to develop your timing and coordination.
