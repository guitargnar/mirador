With an annual income of $75,000 and considering Matthew's financial context, here are some general guidelines to help him save for a house:

1. **Create a budget**: Matthew should allocate 50-30-20: 50% of his income towards necessary expenses (housing, utilities, food), 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards saving and debt repayment.
2. **Set aside 10%-15% of his income for savings**: Based on the 50-30-20 rule, Matthew should aim to save around $7,500-$11,250 per year, or approximately $625-$938 per month.
3. **Prioritize high-interest debt (if any)**: If Matthew has high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, he should focus on paying those off before saving for a house.
4. **Take advantage of tax-advantaged accounts**: Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts like a first-time homebuyer savings account or a traditional IRA/401(k) to optimize his savings.
5. **Explore assistance programs (if applicable)**: As a servant leader, Matthew may be eligible for down payment assistance programs or other government incentives that can help with the cost of homeownership.

To illustrate this, let's break it down further:

Assuming Matthew wants to save 10% of his income ($7,500 per year), here's a rough outline of how he could allocate his monthly income:

* Necessary expenses (housing, utilities, food): $3,750
* Discretionary spending: $2,250
* Savings and debt repayment: $625

Keep in mind that this is just a starting point, and Matthew may need to adjust his budget based on his individual circumstances.
