Alright, the user wants me to create a daily guitar practice routine focused on sweep picking. They mentioned they're a master guitarist in technical death metal with various expertise areas. So, I need to make sure this routine is comprehensive and effective.

First, I should start by understanding what sweep picking entails. It's about moving the pick across multiple strings smoothly, often used for arpeggios or fast passages. The user mentioned they want a daily routine, so it needs to be structured but not overwhelming.

I'll break down the routine into sections: Warm-Up, Basic Sweep Arpeggios, Advanced Techniques, Speed and Control, and Cool Down. Each section should have specific exercises with tabs and instructions. I need to ensure each exercise builds on the previous one, gradually increasing difficulty.

For warm-up, legato triplets are a good start because they help with finger coordination without too much strain. Then moving into basic arpeggios using A minor and G major shapes makes sense since those are common in metal. Including both ascending and descending sweeps will cover different aspects of the technique.

In the advanced section, introducing diminished arpeggios adds complexity. Alternate picking between strings can challenge the player's precision. I should also include exercises that mix sweep picking with tapping or pull-offs to simulate real playing scenarios.

Speed and control are crucial, so incorporating metronome work will help build consistency. Starting slow and increasing tempo is a standard approach but effective. The user might appreciate knowing when to push speed versus maintaining accuracy.

Cooling down with legato patterns helps in maintaining dexterity without overexertion. Ending the session with a review allows for reflection on progress and areas needing improvement.

I should also add tips about relaxation, posture, and avoiding strain. It's important to remind users that consistency is key, even if they can't practice every day, aiming for most days of the week.

Overall, I need to present this in a clear, step-by-step manner with tabs provided where necessary. Each exercise should have specific instructions on timing, techniques, and suggested tempos. This way, the user can follow along easily and track their progress over time.

### Daily Guitar Practice Routine: Sweep Picking Techniques

This routine is designed to build and refine your sweep picking skills in a structured manner. It includes warm-ups, exercises for precision and control, and advanced techniques to challenge your abilities.

---

#### **1. Warm-Up (5-10 minutes)**  
Start with light legato exercises to loosen up your fingers and prepare for sweeping.  

**Exercise 1: Legato Triplets**  
Play these triplets using strict alternate picking or fingerstyle. Focus on smooth, even timing.  

```tab
e|-------------------|
B|-------------------|
G|-------------------|
D|-------------------|
A|-------5-7-5-------|
E|-------------------|
```

Timing: 3/4 time  
Tempo: Start at 60 BPM, gradually increase to 90 BPM.  

---

#### **2. Basic Sweep Arpeggios (15 minutes)**  
Begin with simple arpeggio shapes to build foundational sweep picking technique.  

**Exercise 2: A Minor Arpeggio (Descending Sweep)**  
Use strict alternate picking for the first string, then sweep across the remaining strings.  

```tab
e|-------------------|
B|-------------------|
G|-------------------|
D|-------------------|
A|-------5-7-5-------|
E|-----0-------------|
```

Technique: Start with a downstroke on the root (E string), then sweep up to the 5th fret on the A string. Repeat in reverse for ascending sweeps.  

Timing: 4/4 time  
Tempo: Start at 60 BPM, increase to 120 BPM as you improve.  

**Exercise 3: G Major Arpeggio (Ascending Sweep)**  
Practice sweeping up and down this arpeggio shape.  

```tab
e|-------------------|
B|-------------------|
G|-------------------|
D|-------5-7-5-------|
A|-----0-------------|
E|-------------------|
```

Technique: Use a single pick stroke to sweep across all strings. Focus on muting unwanted notes with your picking hand.  

Timing: 4/4 time  
Tempo: Start at 60 BPM, increase to 120 BPM as you improve.  

---

#### **3. Advanced Sweep Techniques (20 minutes)**  
Incorporate more complex patterns and alternate picking between strings.  

**Exercise 4: Diminished Arpeggio with Alternate Picking**  
This exercise combines sweep picking with alternate picking for a more challenging pattern.  

```tab
e|-------------------|
B|-------------------|
G|-------5-7-5-------|
D|-----0-------------|
A|-------------------|
E|-------------------|
```

Technique: Pick the root (G string) with a downstroke, then sweep up to the 5th fret on the B string. Alternate picking for the next string.  

Timing: 4/4 time  
Tempo: Start at 60 BPM, increase to 120 BPM as you improve.  

**Exercise 5: Sweep with Hammer-Ons and Pull-Offs**  
Combine sweep picking with legato techniques for a more dynamic sound.  

```tab
e|-------------------|
B|-------------------|
G|-------7-5-7-------|
D|-----0-------------|
A|-------------------|
E|-------------------|
```

Technique: Sweep up to the 7th fret on the G string, then hammer-on and pull-off to create a melodic pattern.  

Timing: 4/4 time  
Tempo: Start at 60 BPM, increase to 120 BPM as you improve.  

---

#### **4. Speed and Control (15 minutes)**  
Focus on building speed while maintaining precision. Use a metronome to track your progress.  

**Exercise 6: Metronome Challenge**  
Choose any of the previous exercises and set your metronome to 80 BPM. Play the exercise cleanly at this tempo, then increase by 10 BPM each day.  

Technique: Keep your picking hand relaxed and use minimal movement. Focus on muting unwanted strings with your picking hand.  

---

#### **5. Cool Down (5-10 minutes)**  
End your practice session with a relaxing exercise to cool down and reflect on your progress.  

**Exercise 7: Legato Sweep Pattern**  
Use hammer-ons and pull-offs to create a smooth, melodic sweep pattern.  

```tab
e|-------------------|
B|-------------------|
G|-------5-7-5-------|
D|-----0-------------|
A|-------------------|
E|-------------------|
```

Technique: Hammer-on to the 7th fret on the G string, then pull-off and sweep down to the root.  

Timing: 4/4 time  
Tempo: Start at 60 BPM, increase to 120 BPM as you improve.

### Additional Tips for Sweep Picking Success:
- **Relax Your Hands:** Tension is your enemy. Keep your picking hand relaxed and use minimal movement.
- **Practice Slowly:** Focus on clean execution at slower tempos before increasing speed.
- **Use a Metronome:** Consistency is key. Use a metronome to ensure you’re playing in time.
- **Alternate Picking:** Incorporate alternate picking between strings for more complex patterns.
- **Record Yourself:** Listen back to your practice sessions to identify areas for improvement.

---

### Progress Tracking:
- Write down your progress each day (e.g., "Improved muting on Exercise 2," or "Increased tempo to 100 BPM on Exercise 4").
- Set weekly goals (e.g., master a new exercise, increase speed by 20 BPM).

By following this routine consistently, you’ll develop faster, cleaner sweep picking technique and expand your technical vocabulary on the guitar.
