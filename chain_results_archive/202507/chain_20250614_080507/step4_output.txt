**DECISION:** To optimize Matthew's music education journey, prioritize self-care, boundary setting, and resource development to mitigate burnout, overemphasis on student needs, and limited resources.

**OPTIONS:**
1. **Option 1**: Implement a comprehensive wellness program, including mindfulness workshops, exercise classes, and mental health resources, to support Matthew's physical and emotional well-being.
2. **Option 2**: Establish clear boundaries between Matthew's personal and professional life by setting realistic expectations with colleagues, administrators, and students, ensuring he has sufficient time for self-care and professional development.
3. **Option 3**: Collaborate with the school administration to secure funding and resources (e.g., equipment upgrades, technology integration) that support Matthew's music education initiatives.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Option 1: Implement a comprehensive wellness program
- Enhances Matthew's resilience and ability to manage stress
- Fosters a positive work environment that promotes well-being
- Supports Matthew's long-term job satisfaction and career growth

**NEXT STEPS:**
□ Develop a wellness program proposal with specific goals, objectives, and timelines (this week)
□ Establish a budget for the wellness program and secure necessary resources (next 2 weeks)
□ Schedule mindfulness workshops and exercise classes for Matthew and other staff members (this month)

**WATCH FOR:** ⚠️ Burnout due to excessive workload or lack of self-care
⚠️ Limited resources (e.g., funding, equipment) that hinder the effectiveness of Matthew's music education initiatives
