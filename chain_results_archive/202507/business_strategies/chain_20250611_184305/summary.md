Based on your specified income of $75,000, I'll develop a comprehensive longevity planning strategy tailored to this individual's unique situation.

**Income Confirmation:**
Based on your specified income of $75,000...

**Budget Framework:**
To create a sustainable budget, we'll allocate 50% for essential expenses (housing, food, utilities), 30% for non-essential expenses (entertainment, hobbies), and 20% for savings and debt repayment. This framework will enable the individual to maintain a comfortable lifestyle while prioritizing long-term financial security.

**Long-Term Care Insurance:**
Given the increasing likelihood of living beyond 100 years, it's essential to consider long-term care insurance. A comprehensive plan can help mitigate the financial burden of potential long-term care expenses. We'll explore options for:

1. **Medigap Insurance:** Supplementing Medicare coverage with a Medigap policy can provide additional benefits, such as hospital stays and skilled nursing facility coverage.
2. **Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI):** A LTCI policy can help cover the costs of assisted living facilities, home care, or adult day care services.

Assuming a $75,000 annual income, we'll allocate 5% for long-term care insurance premiums, which translates to approximately $3,750 per year. This amount may vary depending on individual circumstances and insurance provider options.

**Health Optimization:**
To increase the likelihood of living a healthy and long life, we recommend:

1. **Regular Health Check-Ups:** Schedule annual health check-ups with a primary care physician to monitor vital signs, detect potential health issues early, and adjust lifestyle habits accordingly.
2. **Healthy Diet and Exercise:** Focus on consuming a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Engage in regular physical activity, such as walking or swimming, for at least 30 minutes per day.
3. **Stress Management:** Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises to maintain mental well-being.

**Financial Planning:**
To ensure financial stability throughout a potentially long lifespan, we'll focus on:

1. **Retirement Savings:** Contribute at least 10% of the annual income ($7,500) to a tax-advantaged retirement account, such as a 401(k) or IRA.
2. **Investment Portfolio:** Develop a diversified investment portfolio with a mix of low-risk and moderate-risk assets to generate steady returns over the long term.
3. **Inflation Protection:** Include inflation-indexed investments, such as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), to maintain purchasing power.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Medigap Insurance Application:** Research and apply for a Medigap policy that covers hospital stays and skilled nursing facility services.
2. **Long-Term Care Insurance Application:** Explore LTCI options and submit an application, ensuring coverage for potential long-term care expenses.
3. **Health Check-Ups and Lifestyle Adjustments:** Schedule regular health check-ups and implement healthy lifestyle habits to maintain overall well-being.

**Professional Consultation Recommendations:**

1. **Estate Planning:** Engage a qualified estate planning attorney to create a comprehensive will, including advance directives and powers of attorney.
2. **Tax Planning:** Consult with a tax professional to optimize tax strategies, such as charitable donations or tax-loss harvesting.
3. **Financial Advisor:** Regularly review and adjust the investment portfolio with a financial advisor to ensure alignment with long-term goals.
