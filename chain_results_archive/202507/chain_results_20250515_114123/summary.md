What a fascinating challenge!

After analyzing the problem, I propose a chord visualization technique that combines both structural and harmonic information to provide an intuitive representation of chords. This design will be implemented in a web-based application using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (using D3.js for data visualization).

**Chord Visualization Technique:**

1. **Structural Representation:** A 2D grid will be used to represent the chord's structural elements:
	* X-axis: Root note (C, D, E, etc.)
	* Y-axis: Quality (Major, Minor, Diminished, Augmented)
	* Each cell in the grid will contain a small icon indicating the chord type (e.g., C Major would be represented by a yellow triangle).
2. **Harmonic Representation:** A circular layout will be used to visualize the chord's harmonic relationships:
	* The circle will be divided into sections, each representing a specific interval (e.g., major third, perfect fifth) relative to the root note.
	* Each section will contain a small arrow indicating the direction of the interval (up for ascending, down for descending).
3. **Interactive Features:**
	* Hover effects will highlight the structural and harmonic representations, providing additional information about each chord element.
	* Clicking on a cell or section will display a pop-up with detailed information about the chord's properties (e.g., notes, intervals, quality).

**Implementation Details:**

1. HTML5:
	* Create an SVG element for the 2D grid and circular layout.
	* Use CSS3 to style the elements and create visual hierarchy.
2. JavaScript (using D3.js):
	* Generate the 2D grid and circular layouts using D3's geometry functions.
	* Bind data to each cell and section, updating the visualization accordingly.
	* Implement hover and click event listeners for interactive features.
3. Data Preparation:
	* Create a dataset containing chord information (root note, quality, intervals).
	* Preprocess the data to ensure consistent formatting and accuracy.

**Benefits:**

1. **Intuitive Visualization:** The combination of structural and harmonic representations provides an easy-to-understand visual representation of chords.
2. **Easy Navigation:** Users can quickly navigate through different chords by clicking on cells or sections in the grid and circular layouts.
3. **In-Depth Information:** Hover effects and pop-ups provide additional information about each chord element, allowing users to delve deeper into the music theory.

**Future Development:**

1. **Chord Progression Visualization:** Expand the visualization technique to display chord progressions, enabling users to analyze harmonic structures in a more comprehensive manner.
2. **Music Theory Integration:** Integrate with existing music theory resources (e.g., MIDI files, sheet music) to provide a more holistic understanding of chords and their applications.

This design provides a solid foundation for a chord visualization technique that is both informative and engaging. By combining structural and harmonic representations, users can gain a deeper understanding of chord relationships and improve their musical skills.
