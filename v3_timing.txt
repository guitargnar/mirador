Given your startup's current situation, I'd like to provide a comprehensive analysis to help you make an informed decision.

**Current Situation:**

* Burn rate: $150k/month ( unsustainable for 8 months)
* Runway: 8 months
* Revenue: $80k MRR (growing, but not fast enough)
* Employees: 15
* Burn rate: High

**Options Analysis:**

1. **Raise more funding:**
	* Pros:
		+ Extends runway and gives you more time to grow the business
		+ Allows you to continue investing in essential operations and growth initiatives
	* Cons:
		+ Increases debt and potential pressure to repay investors
		+ May lead to over-expansion, diluting growth potential
2. **Cut costs:**
	* Pros:
		+ Reduces burn rate, extending runway
		+ Allows you to maintain operations while minimizing financial risk
	* Cons:
		+ May require significant layoffs or reductions in salaries and benefits
		+ Could impact employee morale and retention
3. **Pivot your business model:**
	* Pros:
		+ Can be a low-risk way to accelerate growth without increasing costs
		+ Allows you to reassess and adapt to changing market conditions
	* Cons:
		+ Requires significant effort and investment in rebranding, marketing, and product development
		+ May not be feasible if your current business model is deeply ingrained

**Recommendation:**

Considering your startup's high burn rate and limited runway, I would recommend **cutting costs** as the most effective solution to extend your runway and minimize financial risk. This approach will allow you to maintain essential operations while reducing unnecessary expenses.

Before making significant cost-cutting measures, consider implementing some of the following:

1. **Salary adjustments:** Reduce salaries for non-essential employees or negotiate with key team members.
2. **Operational efficiencies:** Streamline processes, eliminate redundancies, and optimize resources.
3. **Cost reduction initiatives:** Negotiate with vendors, suppliers, or partners to secure better deals.
4. **Employee restructuring:** Consider laying off non-essential employees or reducing the workforce.

While cost-cutting is essential, it's also crucial to **continue growing revenue** to ensure the long-term sustainability of your business. Focus on:

1. **Upselling and cross-selling:** Optimize your sales process to increase average revenue
