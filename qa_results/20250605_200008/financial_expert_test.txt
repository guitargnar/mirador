**Income Analysis**

Based on the provided income amount of $5,000 per year, we will create a detailed budget for a Louisville family with two children. To calculate the monthly income, we'll divide the annual income by 12.

$5,000 (annual income) รท 12 = approximately $417 (monthly income)

**Budget Framework**

To create a balanced budget, we'll allocate 50% of the monthly income towards necessary expenses, 30% towards discretionary spending, and 20% towards saving and debt repayment.

1. Necessary Expenses (50%): $208.50
	* Housing: $120 (assuming rent or mortgage payment)
	* Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet): $40
	* Food: $30
	* Transportation (car payment, insurance, gas): $20
	* Minimum debt payments (credit cards, loans): $18
2. Discretionary Spending (30%): $125.50
	* Entertainment (dining out, movies, hobbies): $75
	* Personal expenses (clothing, accessories, gadgets): $25
	* Travel: $10
	* Miscellaneous (gifts, subscriptions, unexpected expenses): $35
3. Saving and Debt Repayment (20%): $83
	* Emergency fund: $50
	* Retirement savings: $15
	* Other savings goals (college funds, down payment): $18
