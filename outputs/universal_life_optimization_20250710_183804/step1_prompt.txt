I'm juggling roles as parent, musician, AI innovator, and risk management professional. My energy peaks at 9am and 7pm. How do I structure my days to align high-cognitive tasks with peak 
  energy while ensuring I'm present for my daughter's bedtime routine and maintaining consistent music practice?
