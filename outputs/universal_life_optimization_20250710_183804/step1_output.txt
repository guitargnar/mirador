The art of managing multiple roles while optimizing energy levels! Let's break down your day into blocks, prioritizing high-cognitive tasks during your peak energy periods (9am and 7pm) while ensuring you're present for your daughter's bedtime routine.

**Morning Routine (7:00 am - 9:00 am)**

1. **Family Time**: Start with a 30-minute morning routine that involves spending quality time with your daughter, including breakfast, getting dressed, and having a conversation about her day.
2. **Music Practice**: Allocate 30 minutes for focused music practice or studying (e.g., 7:30 am - 8:00 am). This sets a positive tone for the day and allows you to recharge before the peak energy period.

**Peak Energy Period 1 (9:00 am - 12:00 pm)**

1. **High-Cognitive Task 1**: Dedicate this block to your most critical, high-energy task for the morning (e.g., AI project, risk management work, or a complex music composition).
2. **Break**: Take a 15-minute break to recharge and refocus.

**Mid-Morning Routine (12:00 pm - 2:00 pm)**

1. **Lunch Break**: Spend quality time with your daughter during lunch, engaging in activities that promote bonding and relaxation.
2. **Admin Tasks**: Use this block for administrative tasks like responding to emails, scheduling appointments, or managing your calendar.

**Peak Energy Period 2 (7:00 pm - 9:00 pm)**

1. **High-Cognitive Task 2**: Allocate this block for another critical task that requires high energy and focus (e.g., coding, risk analysis, or a challenging song composition).
2. **Break**: Take a short break to recharge and relax with your daughter.

**Evening Routine (9:00 pm - 10:30 pm)**

1. **Wind Down**: Gradually transition to a more relaxed state by engaging in calming activities like meditation, reading, or spending quality time with your daughter.
2. **Bedtime Routine**: Ensure you're present for your daughter's bedtime routine, maintaining a consistent and loving connection.

**Additional Tips**

* **Schedule Buffer**: Leave 15-30 minutes between tasks to account for unexpected interruptions or energy dips.
* **Self-Care**: Incorporate activities that promote physical and mental well-being, such as exercise, stretching, or hobbies.
* **Prioritize Sleep**: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep to ensure you're well-rested and ready for the next day.
* **Review and Adjust**: Regularly review your schedule and adjust it as needed to maintain balance and optimize energy levels.

By structuring your days in this way, you'll be able to:

* Align high-cognitive tasks with peak energy periods
* Ensure presence during your daughter's bedtime routine
* Maintain consistent music practice
* Balance multiple roles and responsibilities

Remember, flexibility is key. Be willing to adjust this schedule as needed to accommodate your unique needs and preferences.
