The provided code implements a StreamingOrchestrator class that orchestrates progressive model enhancement with streaming, aiming to achieve <1s first token latency with multi-stage processing. The key components of the code are:

1. StreamToken: Represents a token in the streaming response, containing content, confidence, stage, model, metadata, and timestamp attributes.
2. ModelStage: Configures a model stage with name, model, confidence, timeout, system_prompt, stage_type, and options attributes.
3. StreamingOrchestrator: Orchestrates progressive model enhancement with streaming. It has stages (list of ModelStage instances), start_time, first_token_time, and _warmed_models (set of pre-warmed models) attributes.
4. process method: Processes a query through progressive enhancement stages, yielding StreamToken objects. It selects active stages, accumulates context for each stage, and builds messages for model streaming.
5. _warm_model method: Pre-warms a model by generating a response with a short prompt to reduce first token latency.
6. _get_stage_emoji method: Returns an emoji based on the stage name.
7. _build_messages method: Builds messages for model streaming, including system and user prompts.
8. example_usage function: Demonstrates the usage of StreamingOrchestrator by printing a streaming example with colored tokens based on confidence levels.

The code follows a progressive enhancement pattern, where multiple stages are defined to gradually enhance the response quality while maintaining low latency. The stages are configured with different models, confidence thresholds, and system prompts to guide the model's response generation.

Key relationships:
- StreamingOrchestrator has a list of ModelStage instances (stages) that define the progressive enhancement pipeline.
- Each ModelStage instance has a name, model, confidence, timeout, system_prompt, stage_type, and options attributes to configure the model behavior.
- The process method in StreamingOrchestrator orchestrates the streaming by selecting active stages, accumulating context, and building messages for each stage.
- The _warm_model method pre-warms models to reduce first token latency.
- The _get_stage_emoji method provides emojis based on stage names for visual representation.
- The _build_messages method constructs messages for model streaming, including system and user prompts.

Identified patterns:
- Progressive enhancement: The code implements a progressive enhancement pattern by defining multiple stages with increasing complexity and quality. Each stage builds upon the previous one to enhance the response.
- Model configuration: Each ModelStage instance is configured with specific model, confidence, timeout, system_prompt, and options attributes to guide the model's behavior and response generation.
- Streaming response generation: The process method in StreamingOrchestrator generates a streaming response by selecting active stages, accumulating context, and building messages for each stage.

Potential issues or areas for improvement:
- Model selection: The current code uses fixed models for each stage. While this provides a controlled environment, it may not be optimal for all use cases. Consider allowing dynamic model selection based on the query or user preferences.
- Pre-warming strategy: The pre-warming strategy currently pre-warms only the first stage model. Consider pre-warming multiple stages in parallel to further reduce latency.
- Error handling: The code handles exceptions during model streaming by yielding a StreamToken with an error message. However, more robust error handling and logging could be implemented to capture and handle various types of errors.
- Context accumulation: The accumulated_context variable is used to pass context between stages. Consider using a more structured approach, such as a dictionary or object, to store and manage context information effectively.

Recommendations:
1. Implement dynamic model selection based on query complexity or user preferences to optimize the response quality and latency.
2. Pre-warm multiple stages in parallel to further reduce first token latency. This can be achieved by running pre-warming tasks concurrently using asyncio.gather().
3. Enhance error handling and logging mechanisms to capture and handle various types of errors during model streaming. Implement exception handling for specific error cases and provide informative error messages.
4. Use a structured context management approach, such as a dictionary or object, to store and manage context information effectively between stages. This will improve code readability and maintainability.
5. Consider adding unit tests to ensure the correctness of the StreamingOrchestrator class and its methods. Test different scenarios, including error handling, pre-warming, and context accumulation.

Example usage:
```python
orchestrator = StreamingOrchestrator(pre_warm=True)
query = "What are the three most important things I should focus on today?"
async for token in orchestrator.process(query):
    print(token.content, end="", flush=True)
```

By following these recommendations and implementing dynamic model selection, parallel pre-warming, enhanced error handling, structured context management, and unit tests, the StreamingOrchestrator class can be further optimized to achieve better performance, maintainability, and reliability in progressive enhancement streaming.<EOS_TOKEN><EOS_TOKEN><EOS_TOKEN>
