**Changes:**

1. Added error handling for `bandit.run()` and `lint()` functions.
2. Fixed security issues using bandit's suggested fixes.
3. Fixed code style issues using pylint's suggested fixes.
4. Removed unnecessary variables and improved code organization.

This optimized version of the code includes better error handling, security checks, and code optimization. It also follows Humana's security best practices and is more efficient than the original version.
