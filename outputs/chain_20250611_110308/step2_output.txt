I'll expand on the comprehensive life optimization plan for Matthew and his girlfriend, incorporating additional expert perspectives and tailored guidance.

**Current Financial Assessment**

Matthew and his girlfriend have a combined monthly take-home income of $6,200. They are currently living in a shared house with a mortgage of $49,000, which they aim to pay off as quickly as possible. Their expenses include:

* Necessary expenses (50% of income): $3,100
* Discretionary spending (30% of income): $1,860
* Saving and debt repayment (20% of income): $1,240

**Opportunity Analysis**

To further optimize their financial situation, Matthew and his girlfriend should consider the following opportunities:

* **Side hustles**: Matthew can explore side hustles to increase his income, such as freelancing or selling products online. His girlfriend can also consider starting a part-time business or taking on additional work.
* **Investing in real estate**: With their combined household income, they may be able to invest in a rental property or a real estate investment trust (REIT) to diversify their investments and generate passive income.
* **Tax optimization**: As Kentucky residents, Matthew and his girlfriend should take advantage of the state's flat tax rate of 5% on taxable income. They can also explore local tax incentives and credits available in Jefferson County.

**Specific Recommendations with Numbers**

1. **Increase income**: Matthew should aim to increase his income by 20% within the next 12 months, which would translate to an additional $1,240 per month.
2. **Pay off mortgage**: With their combined income, they can allocate a significant portion towards paying off their mortgage. Aiming to pay off the remaining $49,000 in 24 months would require a monthly payment of approximately $2,042.
3. **Invest in retirement**: Matthew and his girlfriend should contribute at least 10% of their combined income to tax-advantaged retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) or IRA.
