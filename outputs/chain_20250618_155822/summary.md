**Monthly Budget Breakdown:**

Assuming Matthew's annual income is $75,000, his monthly gross income would be approximately $6,250 ($75,000 / 12). Here's a breakdown of his monthly expenses:

1. **Housing:** Assuming a median home price in Louisville (~$250,000), Matthew's mortgage payment could be around $1,200-$1,500 per month (assuming a 20% down payment and a 30-year mortgage at 4% interest). If he chooses to rent, his monthly rent could be around $1,200-1,600.

**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations:**

* However, housing costs can be higher due to the city's growing popularity and limited supply of affordable homes.
* Traffic and parking can be challenging, especially during rush hour.

**Kentucky State Tax Implications:**

As a resident of Kentucky, Matthew will need to pay 5% state income tax on his earnings. This means he'll take home approximately $58,750 per year ($75,000 x 0.95), or around $4,875 per month.

**Local Financial Resources and Opportunities:**

* **Kentucky Small Business Development Center (KSBC):** Offers free business consulting, training, and resources for entrepreneurs.
* **Louisville Metro Economic Alliance:** Provides information on local job opportunities, business incentives, and economic development initiatives.
* **University of Louisville's Entrepreneurship Center:** Offers resources, workshops, and mentorship programs for aspiring entrepreneurs.

To achieve his financial goal of $75,000, Matthew may need to diversify his income streams, be proactive about marketing himself and his services, and continually develop new revenue-generating opportunities. Some potential strategies include:

* Investing in online courses or tutorials to increase his earning potential from music lessons or workshops.
* Building a strong social media presence to promote his affiliate marketing and sponsored content efforts.
* Networking with other musicians, entrepreneurs, and industry professionals to explore new business opportunities.
