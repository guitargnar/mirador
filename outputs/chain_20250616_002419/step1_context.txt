Based on your specified income of $[AMOUNT]... 

To create a comprehensive budget framework, I'll need to extract the income amount from your request. However, you haven't provided an income amount yet.

Please provide me with your annual or monthly income in any format (e.g., $50,000, 50000, fifty thousand). I'll convert it to a clean number and proceed with creating a personalized budget plan tailored to Louisville/Jefferson County context.

Additionally, please note that this information is for educational purposes only. Consult with qualified financial professionals for personalized advice.

Once you provide the income amount, I'll be happy to assist you in:

1. Creating a comprehensive budget framework
2. Including Louisville-specific considerations (e.g., Kentucky state income tax, Jefferson County property tax rates)
3. Adding implementation steps with local resources (e.g., Louisville Metro Government, JCPS, TARC)

Please share your income amount, and we'll get started!
