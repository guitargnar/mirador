Thank you for providing more specific details about your priorities, challenges, and existing plans for next week. Based on your input, I'll refine my previous recommendation to better address your needs.

To confirm, your top 3-5 priorities for strategic planning next week are:

1. Finding a new home that meets your growing family's needs
2. Improving work-life balance to spend more time with your daughter
3. Advancing in your career to increase earning potential

You're facing challenges related to:

* Time constraints: With the lease ending in August, you need to find a new home before then.

You have existing plans and commitments that might impact your ability to focus on strategic planning:

* Your girlfriend's lease ends in August
* Upcoming appointments with real estate agents and potential new homes
* Work deadlines and responsibilities

**Revised Approach Recommendation**

Based on your input, I recommend the following revised approach:

1. **Decision Simplifier**: Use the Decision Simplifier model to identify key areas of focus and prioritize tasks based on their potential impact.
2. **Enhanced Agent Enforcer**: Leverage the Enhanced Agent Enforcer model to create a strategic plan that aligns with your priorities and addresses any obstacles or challenges.
3. **Financial Planning Expert**: If financial planning is relevant to your goals, consider using the Financial Planning Expert model to analyze potential financial implications and make informed decisions.

**Specific Model Sequence Suggestion**

Here's a revised suggested sequence of models to help you achieve your strategic planning goals:

1. Start with the Decision Simplifier model to identify key areas of focus.
2. Use the Enhanced Agent Enforcer model to create a strategic plan that aligns with your priorities and addresses any obstacles or challenges.

**Expected Outcome Prediction**

By following this revised approach, I predict that you'll be able to:

* Make informed decisions that align with your goals and priorities

**Additional Insights**

Considering your current situation, I'd like to highlight a few additional factors that might impact your strategic planning:

* Your girlfriend's lease ending in August may create a sense of urgency around finding a new home.
* You're currently exploring options for a more expensive home, which may require adjusting your budget and priorities.
* Your daughter starting 2nd grade will likely influence your decision-making around finding a new home that's closer to her school.

**Recommendations with Numbers**

To get started, I recommend the following:

1. Allocate $5,000 from your emergency fund for down payment on a new home.
2. Research and explore 3-4 potential neighborhoods in Louisville that meet your family's needs, including proximity to schools and amenities.
3. Schedule meetings with at least 2 real estate agents who specialize in luxury homes in the next 2 weeks.

**Implementation Timeline**

To implement these recommendations, I suggest the following timeline:

* Week 1: Research neighborhoods and schedule meetings with real estate agents
* Week 2-3: Visit potential new homes and assess their pros and cons
* Week 4-5: Finalize a decision on a new home and begin the process of making an offer

**Risk Considerations**

Some potential risks to consider include:

* The housing market in Louisville may be competitive, which could impact your ability to find a suitable home.
* Adjusting your budget to accommodate a more expensive home may require making lifestyle changes.
