**Financial Planning Performance Test**

As a certified financial planning expert, I'll put my skills to the test by guiding you through a simulated financial planning scenario. Please follow along and provide me with your input.

**Scenario:**

You're a 35-year-old married couple living in Louisville, Kentucky, with two young children (ages 6 and 8). Your combined income is $120,000 per year, with $80,000 coming from your husband's job as an engineer and $40,000 from your part-time job as a teacher. You both have excellent credit scores.

Your current financial situation is:

* Savings: $20,000 in a high-yield savings account
* Debt:
	+ Mortgage (5-year fixed rate): $150,000 at 4% interest
	+ Car loan (3-year term): $30,000 at 6% interest
	+ Student loans (10-year term): $50,000 at 4% interest
* Expenses:
	+ Housing: $2,500/month
	+ Transportation: $1,200/month
	+ Food: $800/month
	+ Insurance: $300/month
	+ Entertainment: $500/month

**Goal:** Create a comprehensive financial plan to achieve the following goals:

1. Pay off high-interest debt within 3 years
2. Build an emergency fund covering 6-12 months of living expenses
3. Increase savings rate to 20% of combined income
4. Plan for college funds and retirement contributions

1. What are your top financial priorities?
