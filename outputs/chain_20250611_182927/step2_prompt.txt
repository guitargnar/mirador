Based on your specified income of $0 (no income provided), I'll assume you're starting from scratch and aiming to create a diversified passive income portfolio that can potentially generate $5,000 per month in 3 years.

To achieve this goal, we'll need to consider various investment options with different risk profiles. Please note that this is a general outline, and actual results may vary.

**Assumptions:**

1. Starting from scratch with no initial investments.
2. A 3-year time horizon for achieving the desired monthly passive income.
3. A moderate-risk tolerance, aiming to balance growth and stability.
4. Utilizing a mix of low-to-moderate risk investments to minimize volatility.

**Diversified Passive Income Portfolio:**

To generate $5,000 per month in 3 years, we'll allocate your portfolio across various asset classes with different income streams. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. **Dividend-paying Stocks (30%):**
	* Allocate $15,000 to a mix of established dividend-payers like:
		+ Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
		+ Procter & Gamble (PG)
		+ Coca-Cola (KO)
		+ Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) like Realty Income (O)
2. **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) (20%):**
	* Invest $10,000 in REITs that focus on income generation, such as:
		+ Ventas (VTR)
		+ Welltower (WELL)
3. **Peer-to-Peer Lending (15%):**
	* Allocate $7,500 to a reputable P2P lending platform like:
		+ Lending Club
		+ Prosper
4. **Index Funds or ETFs (20%):**
	* Invest $10,000 in a diversified index fund or ETF that tracks the overall market, such as:
		+ Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX)
5. **High-Yield Savings Account (5%):**
	* Keep $2,500 in a high-yield savings account to provide liquidity and earn interest.

**Projected Monthly Income:**

Based on historical data and assumptions, here's a rough estimate of the projected monthly income from each investment category:

1. Dividend-paying Stocks: $800 - $1,200 per month
2. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs): $400 - $600 per month
3. Peer-to-Peer Lending: $300 - $500 per month
4. Index Funds or ETFs: $100 - $300 per month
5. High-Yield Savings Account: $50 - $100 per month

Total projected monthly income: $1,550 - $2,400

To reach your target of $5,000 per month in 3 years, we'll need to consider additional strategies:

**Additional Strategies:**

1. **Compounding:** Take advantage of compound interest by reinvesting dividends and interest.
2. **Dollar-Cost Averaging:** Invest a fixed amount regularly to reduce market volatility.
3. **Tax-Efficient Investing:** Consider tax implications when investing in dividend-paying stocks or REITs.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Open a brokerage account with a reputable online broker, such as Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Vanguard.
2. Fund your portfolio with the allocated amounts.
3. Set up automatic investments to implement dollar-cost averaging and compounding.
4. Monitor and adjust your portfolio periodically to ensure it remains aligned with your goals.

**Professional Consultation Recommendations:**

1. Consider consulting a financial advisor or planner for personalized guidance on creating a diversified passive income portfolio.
2. Review and update your investment strategy regularly to ensure it aligns with changing market conditions and your goals.
