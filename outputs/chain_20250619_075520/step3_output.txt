**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today):**

- **Review and adjust budget categories**: Take a closer look at your monthly expenses and ensure that you're allocating funds effectively. Consider using the 50/30/20 rule: 50% for essential expenses, 30% for discretionary spending, and 20% for savings and debt repayment.
- **Check credit report and score**: Obtain a copy of your credit report from the three major credit bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax) and review it for any errors or inaccuracies. Your credit score can impact your ability to secure loans or credit cards at favorable interest rates.
- **Research local financial resources**: Visit the websites of the Louisville Metro Government, Kentucky Housing Corporation, and United Way of Greater Louisville to learn more about available financial assistance programs and community development initiatives.

**SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (This Week):**

- **Create a savings plan**: Allocate a specific amount each month for emergency fund contributions, retirement savings, and debt repayment. Consider setting up automatic transfers from your checking account to make saving easier and less prone to being neglected.

**STRATEGIC ACTIONS (This Month):**
