Based on the provided context, here's an evaluation of the feasibility of a real estate investment in your area:

**Income:** With a target income of $75,000, you have a relatively modest income. However, as a creative technologist with multiple revenue streams (e.g., touring guitarist with Cody Ash), it's likely that your actual income exceeds this target.

Assuming an average annual after-tax income of 1.5-2 times the target income ($112,500 - $150,000), you have sufficient disposable income to invest in real estate.

**Lifestyle:** As a servant leader and musician, your lifestyle is likely focused on creativity, community engagement, and family time. This may limit your availability for hands-on property management or long-term tenancy.

However, with a partner or support system, it's possible to balance your personal life with the responsibilities of real estate ownership.

**Long-term financial goals:** Your goal of building multiple revenue streams is consistent with a diversified investment portfolio, which can include real estate. Real estate investments can provide passive income through rental properties or appreciation in property value over time.

To achieve your long-term financial goals, consider investing in:

1. **Rental properties**: With a relatively stable income and a partner or support system, you can invest in rental properties that generate steady cash flow.
2. **Real estate investment trusts (REITs)**: REITs allow you to invest in real estate without directly managing properties. This option provides liquidity and diversification benefits.
3. **Real estate crowdfunding**: Platforms like Fundrise, Rich Uncles, or RealtyMogul offer opportunities to invest in real estate development projects or existing properties with lower minimum investment requirements.

**Feasibility assessment:**

Considering your income, lifestyle, and long-term financial goals, investing in real estate is feasible for you. However, it's essential to:

1. **Assess your risk tolerance**: Real estate investments carry risks like market fluctuations, tenant vacancies, or property damage.
2. **Diversify your portfolio**: Spread your investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to minimize risk.
3. **Prioritize cash flow**: Focus on generating steady income through rental properties or REITs to ensure a stable financial foundation.

To get started, consider consulting with a financial advisor or real estate expert who can help you:

1. **Evaluate your creditworthiness**: Assess your credit score and history to determine the best investment options.
2. **Research local market trends**: Understand the Louisville real estate market, including current prices, rental yields, and growth prospects.
3. **Develop a customized investment strategy**: Based on your goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation, create a tailored plan for investing in real estate.

By taking a thoughtful and informed approach, you can make an educated decision about investing in real estate and achieve your long-term financial objectives.
