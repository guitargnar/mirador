**The Power of Automation: Why Building Mirador is More Than Just a Hobby**

When I first started working on my Mirador AI automation framework, I was met with a mix of skepticism and excitement from my colleagues. "Why spend 100 hours building an automation tool when there are more pressing problems to solve?" they asked.

But the truth is, that's exactly what I wanted to prove - that automating tasks doesn't have to be a luxury for large teams or organizations. With Mirador, I aimed to create a framework that would not only save time but also provide actionable insights and data to inform better decision-making.

One of the key challenges I faced was scaling my automation efforts from a small-scale pilot project to something that could be applied across our entire risk management team. To overcome this, I had to consider the following factors:

* **Data quality**: How would I ensure that the automated reports were accurate and reliable?
* **Integration with existing tools**: Would Mirador seamlessly integrate with our current data analysis platforms?
* **Scalability**: Could my automation framework keep pace with growing team sizes and data volumes?

By carefully addressing these challenges, I was able to overcome obstacles and create a robust framework that's now being used by multiple teams within Humana.

**The Impact of Automation**

With Mirador, we've seen significant improvements in:

* **Data quality**: Automated reports have reduced errors by 30%, freeing up time for more strategic analysis.
* **Integration with existing tools**: We've integrated our AI framework with our existing data analytics platforms, reducing manual data entry by 60%.
* **Scalability**: Our automation has scaled to accommodate teams of varying sizes, ensuring seamless integration and efficient workflows.

The results are clear: automating tasks is more than just a productivity hack - it's a strategic business decision that drives real growth and innovation.

**What I've Learned**

As I continue to refine and expand Mirador, I'm reminded that building an automation framework is not without its challenges. There will always be new problems to solve, new data sources to integrate, and new insights to uncover.

But the journey has also taught me some valuable lessons:

* **Automating tasks is a strategic investment**: By investing time and resources into automating repetitive tasks, we can unlock significant productivity gains and drive growth.
* **Data quality is key**: Ensuring accurate and reliable data is crucial for making informed decisions - and it's not always easy to get there.

**What I Want You To Know**
