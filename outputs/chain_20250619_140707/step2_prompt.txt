As Matthew Scott's personal context provider, I'll outline a music business financial plan tailored to his goals and values.

**Income Streams:**

1. **Touring Guitarist with Cody Ash**: With a target income of $75,000, Matthew aims to secure regular touring gigs with Cody Ash as his guitarist. This will generate approximately 40% of his desired annual income ($30,000).
2. **Music Career Development**: As a creative technologist and musician, Matthew plans to create and sell music-related products (e.g., online courses, ebooks, or software). This will contribute around 20% of his target income ($15,000).
3. **Session Work and Collaborations**: Matthew aims to offer session guitar services and collaborate with other musicians on projects. This will generate around 15% of his desired annual income ($11,250).
4. **Merchandise Sales**: Selling merchandise (e.g., T-shirts, stickers) at live shows or online will contribute approximately 10% of his target income ($7,500).
5. **Sponsorships and Endorsements**: Matthew plans to secure sponsorships and endorsements from music gear companies, tech brands, or other relevant organizations. This will generate around 15% of his desired annual income ($11,250).

**Expenses:**

1. **Equipment and Gear Maintenance**: As a touring musician, Matthew needs to invest in high-quality equipment and maintain it regularly. Estimated expense: $5,000 per year.
2. **Travel and Accommodation**: Touring will require significant travel expenses, including flights, hotels, and food. Estimated expense: $15,000 per year.
3. **Marketing and Promotion**: To promote his music career, Matthew needs to invest in marketing and promotion efforts (e.g., social media advertising, promotional materials). Estimated expense: $5,000 per year.
4. **Insurance and Liability**: As a musician, Matthew should consider liability insurance and other forms of protection. Estimated expense: $2,000 per year.

**Financial Projections:**

* Year 1: $30,000 (touring) + $10,000 (music career development) = $40,000
* Year 2: $35,000 (touring) + $12,500 (music career development) = $47,500
* Year 3: $40,000 (touring) + $15,000 (music career development) = $55,000

**Cash Flow Management:**

To ensure a stable financial situation, Matthew should:

1. Set aside 20% of his income for taxes and savings.
2. Create an emergency fund to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.
3. Monitor his cash flow closely, adjusting his spending and income streams as needed.

By following this financial plan, Matthew can achieve his music business goals while maintaining a stable financial situation and prioritizing his values (faith, family, creativity, community impact).
