**DECISION:** To effectively evaluate the performance of an AI model, it is essential to understand the core decision to prioritize accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score based on the specific problem and dataset characteristics.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Accuracy**: Prioritize accuracy when evaluating a simple model with an easy-to-understand dataset.
2. **Precision**: Focus on precision when dealing with binary classification problems where false positives can have significant consequences.
3. **Recall**: Emphasize recall when working with imbalanced datasets or rare events that require detection.

**RECOMMENDATION:**

* Use **F1-score** as the primary evaluation metric for balanced and nuanced performance assessment, especially in binary classification problems.
- Provides a balanced evaluation of precision and recall.
- Suitable for imbalanced datasets where both precision and recall are important.

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Evaluate dataset characteristics to determine the most suitable evaluation metric (accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score).
□ Select an appropriate evaluation metric based on problem requirements and dataset balance.
□ Refine model performance by adjusting hyperparameters, feature engineering, or model selection as needed.

**WATCH FOR:**

⚠️ **Overfitting**: Be cautious of overfitting when using accuracy or precision metrics, especially with small datasets. Regularly monitor model performance on unseen data to prevent overfitting.
⚠️ **Class imbalance**: Be aware of class imbalance issues in the dataset and adjust evaluation metrics accordingly (e.g., use F1-score for balanced datasets).
