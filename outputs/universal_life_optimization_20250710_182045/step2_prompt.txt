Here are some strategies to help you achieve this balance:

**Work-Life Balance Strategies:**

1.  **Create a schedule**: Plan out your day, week, and month in advance. Set clear boundaries between work, family time, and personal activities.
2.  **Prioritize family time**: Make time for Sage, whether it's during the week or on weekends. Schedule regular family activities, like dinner together, game nights, or outdoor adventures.
3.  **Set boundaries at work**: Establish clear expectations with your manager and colleagues about your work hours, availability, and response times. This will help you stay focused on work during work hours and avoid the temptation to work too much.
4.  **Take breaks**: Take regular breaks throughout the day to recharge and spend time with Sage. Use this time to do something enjoyable together, like playing a game or going for a walk.
5.  **Communicate with your partner**: Share your schedule and needs with your partner, Carey, to ensure you're both on the same page and can support each other.
