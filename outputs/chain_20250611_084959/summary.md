Here is a conversation script:

[Setting: A quiet evening at home, Matthew and his girlfriend are sitting on the couch together]

Matthew: "Hey, can we talk about something that's been on my mind lately?"

Girlfriend: "What's up? Everything okay?"

Matthew: "Yeah, everything's fine. It's just... with [daughter's name] starting 2nd grade soon, I was thinking a lot about our schedule and how it might impact her."

Girlfriend: "Oh, yeah! I've been thinking about that too. What did you have in mind?"

Matthew: "Well, I was thinking we could try a 2-2-3 schedule for [daughter's name]. You know, where she spends two days with me, two days with your mom, and three days with us together."

Girlfriend: "That sounds like it could work. What made you think of that?"

Matthew: "I figured it would be good for her to have some consistency in her routine, especially since she's starting a new school. And it would also give us both more time with her on the weekends and during the week when we're not working."

Girlfriend: "That makes sense. I like it. But what about my work schedule? My mom works Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Wednesdays... how would that fit into this plan?"

Matthew: "I know it's a bit of an adjustment for you, but I think it could actually be beneficial. You'll have two days off during the week when [daughter's name] is with your mom, which will give you some extra time to focus on yourself or run errands. And on Wednesdays, you can still spend time with her and me together."

Girlfriend: "Hmm, I never thought of it that way. Okay, I'm in. Let's try the 2-2-3 schedule!"

Matthew: "Awesome! I think this will be a great change for all of us. And who knows, maybe we can even make some new memories along the way."

Girlfriend: [smiling] "Definitely. I love you."

Matthew: [smiling back] "I love you too."
