**Situation Assessment**

To optimize the Mirador system for your needs, I'd like to understand more about your goals and current usage patterns. Can you please provide me with the following information:

1. What is your primary objective using the Mirador system (e.g., generating leads, making financial decisions, providing customer support)?
2. How are you currently interacting with the system (e.g., which specialist models, chains, and prompts are you using)?
3. Are there any specific pain points or challenges you're experiencing with the system?

**Optimal Approach Recommendation**

Based on your input, I'll provide a tailored recommendation for optimizing your Mirador system usage.

**Specific Model Sequence Suggestion**

I'll suggest a combination of specialist models that can help you achieve your objectives. For example:

1. Start with the `matthew_context_provider` model to analyze your personal context and situation.
2. Use the `financial_planning_expert_v6` model to generate Louisville-specific financial planning recommendations.
3. Follow up with the `louisville_expert_v2` model to gain insights into Jefferson County resources, regulations, and opportunities.

**Expected Outcome Prediction**

Based on this suggested model sequence, I predict that you'll be able to:

* Gain a deeper understanding of your personal context and situation
* Receive tailored financial planning recommendations for Louisville-specific investments
* Identify valuable resources, regulations, and opportunities in Jefferson County

**Alternative Strategies (if applicable)**

If you'd like to explore alternative approaches, I can offer the following options:

1. Use the `enhanced_agent_enforcer` model to generate strategic synthesis and implementation plans.
2. Apply the `decision_simplifier` model to prioritize actions and simplify decision-making.

Please let me know if you'd like to explore any of these alternatives or if you have any further questions.
