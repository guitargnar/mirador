Building on User's personal context: Based on our conversation earlier, it seems like you've established a flexible yet intentional morning routine. As I recall:

You plan to spend 5-7 hours each weekend morning (before your child wakes up) working on AI projects and building your Annapurna band model. This allows you to make progress on your innovation while still having time with your child during their non-custody schedule.

Additionally, you've also mentioned that after bedtime (around 8:30 pm), you dedicate 90 minutes each evening for focused AI work before winding down for the night.

As a universal strategy architect, analyze this situation through multiple strategic lenses. Connect the personal insights to broader strategic frameworks. How do we scale these personal patterns into actionable business/life strategies? What are the systemic implications and interconnections?
