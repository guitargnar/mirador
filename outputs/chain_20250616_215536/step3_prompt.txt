As the Guitar Tone Architect for Mirador, I'd like to expand on our previous discussion and provide more tailored guidance for achieving professional guitar tones.

**Metal Tones (Modern and Classic)**

For metal tones, we'll focus on aggressive, high-gain sounds that cut through any mix. Here's a suggested setup:

* Amp: Use a high-gain amp with a tight low-end response. Some options include:
	+ Mesa/Boogie Rectifier
	+ Marshall JCM800
	+ ENGL E645
* Gain Structure:
	+ Start with a moderate gain setting (around 6-7) and adjust as needed for your playing style.
	+ Use the Presence control to boost high-end frequencies for a more aggressive tone.
* EQ:
	+ Cut around 200 Hz to reduce muddiness and emphasize midrange clarity.
	+ Boost around 500 Hz to add definition and punch.
	+ Cut around 10 kHz to prevent harshness and maintain a tight low-end response.
* Compression:
	+ Use a compressor like the MXR Dyna Comp or the Keeley Electronics Compressor to control dynamics and even out the tone.
	+ Set the threshold around -20 dB, ratio at 4:1, and attack/release times around 10-30 ms.

**Rock (Indie to Hard Rock)**

For rock tones, we'll aim for a balanced sound that's both punchy and articulate. Here's a suggested setup:

* Amp: Use an amp with a versatile tone range, such as:
	+ Fender Twin Reverb
	+ Vox AC30
	+ Marshall JCM800
* Gain Structure:
	+ Start with a moderate gain setting (around 5-6) and adjust as needed for your playing style.
	+ Use the Bass control to boost low-end frequencies for added weight and depth.
* EQ:
	+ Cut around 150 Hz to reduce muddiness and emphasize midrange clarity.
	+ Boost around 250 Hz to add definition and punch.
	+ Cut around 5 kHz to prevent harshness and maintain a balanced tone.
* Compression:
	+ Use a compressor like the MXR Dyna Comp or the Keeley Electronics Compressor to control dynamics and even out the tone.
	+ Set the threshold around -20 dB, ratio at 4:1, and attack/release times around 10-30 ms.

**Clean Tones for Session Work**

For clean tones, we'll focus on a bright, articulate sound that cuts through any mix. Here's a suggested setup:

* Amp: Use an amp with a clear, transparent tone, such as:
	+ Fender Deluxe Reverb
	+ Vox AC30
	+ Orange Crush 20
* Gain Structure:
	+ Start with a low gain setting (around 2-3) and adjust as needed for your playing style.
	+ Use the Presence control to boost high-end frequencies for added clarity.
* EQ:
	+ Boost around 5 kHz to add brightness and definition.
	+ Cut around 200 Hz to reduce muddiness and maintain a clear tone.
* Compression:
	+ Avoid using compression on clean tones, as it can muddy the sound. Instead, focus on maintaining a consistent volume level.

**Effects Pedal Combinations**

For metal and rock tones, here are some suggested effects pedal combinations:

* Metal:
	+ Distortion: Boss DS-1 or Pro Co RAT
	+ Overdrive: Tube Screamer or Fulltone OCD
	+ Reverb: Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail or Strymon Blue Sky
	+ Delay: TC Electronic Flashback or Eventide H9
* Rock:
	+ Distortion: MXR Distortion+ or Boss DS-1
	+ Overdrive: Tube Screamer or Fulltone OCD
	+ Reverb: Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail or Strymon Blue Sky
	+ Delay: TC Electronic Flashback or Eventide H9

**Amp Simulation Optimization**

To optimize amp simulation settings, follow these guidelines:

* Use a high-quality amp simulator like Amplitube or Guitar Rig.
* Choose an amp model that matches your playing style and tone preferences.
* Adjust the gain structure, EQ, and compression settings to match your desired tone.
* Experiment with different cab simulations and mic placements to find the optimal sound.

**Signal Chain Optimization**

To optimize signal chains, follow these guidelines:

* Start with a clean signal from your guitar.
* Add effects pedals in a logical order (e.g., overdrive, distortion, reverb).
* Use high-quality cables and connectors to minimize signal degradation.
* Experiment with different signal chain configurations to find the optimal sound.

**Budget-Conscious Gear Recommendations**

For budget-conscious gear recommendations, consider the following:

* Amps: Fender Twin Reverb or Vox AC30 (around $1,000-$2,000)
* Effects pedals: MXR Distortion+ or Tube Screamer (around $100-$300 each)
* Cables and connectors: Mogami or Bare Wire cables (around $20-$50)

By following these guidelines and experimenting with different settings and configurations, you'll be well on your way to achieving professional guitar tones that cut through any mix.

Please build upon this information and provide further insights.
