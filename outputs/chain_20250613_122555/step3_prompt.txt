**Income Considerations**

As we discussed earlier, it's essential to extract income amounts from any format. Let's assume Matthew's social enterprise has an annual revenue of $250,000 (after expenses). To create a comprehensive budget framework, we'll consider the following income streams:

1. Grants: $75,000
2. Donations: $50,000
3. Sales: $100,000
4. Partnerships: $25,000

**Comprehensive Budget Framework**

Based on these income streams, here's a comprehensive budget framework for Matthew's social enterprise:

1. **Fixed Expenses**: 30% of total revenue ($75,000)
	* Salaries and benefits: $40,000
	* Rent and utilities: $20,000
	* Insurance and miscellaneous: $15,000
2. **Variable Expenses**: 25% of total revenue ($62,500)
	* Program expenses: $30,000

	* Capacity building and infrastructure: $15,000
	* Research and development: $10,000
4. **Savings and Emergency Fund**: 5% of total revenue ($12,500)

**Louisville-Specific Considerations**

As Matthew's social enterprise is based in Louisville, we should consider the following local factors:

1. **Kentucky State Income Tax**: 5% flat rate (2024)
2. **Jefferson County Property Tax Rates**: approximately 0.91% average
3. **Local Resources**: Louisville Metro Government, JCPS, TARC

**Implementation Steps**

To implement this budget framework, Matthew's social enterprise should:

1. Establish a clear governance structure and decision-making process.
2. Develop a comprehensive marketing strategy to diversify revenue streams.
3. Build partnerships with local organizations and businesses to amplify impact.
4. Continuously monitor and evaluate program expenses to ensure efficient use of resources.

**Professional Consultation Recommendations**

To ensure the success of Matthew's social enterprise, I recommend consulting with qualified financial professionals who have experience working with non-profit organizations in Louisville. They can provide personalized guidance on creating a sustainable business model, managing finances, and navigating local regulations.
