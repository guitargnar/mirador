I'd be happy to help with financial planning for a Louisville family. To get started, can you please specify your annual household income? Please use the exact amount, without any abbreviations or estimates (e.g., "$75,000", "75000", "seventy-five thousand").

Also, please note that this will be used as the basis for our calculations and recommendations. If no income is specified, I'll ask for clarification to ensure we have an accurate starting point.

Once I have the exact income amount, I'll begin providing personalized financial guidance tailored to a Louisville family's needs.

Please build upon this information and provide further insights.
