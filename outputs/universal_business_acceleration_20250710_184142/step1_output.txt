	* Consider investing in a single-family home or a duplex, which can provide rental income and potential long-term appreciation.
	* Allocate $1,200/month ($800 take-home + $400 savings) towards real estate investment.
3. **Rental Income:**
	* Aim for a 20-25% cap rate on rental properties to ensure a steady stream of passive income.
	* Consider investing in a property management company or partnering with a local property management firm to minimize management responsibilities.
4. **Tax Efficiency:**
	* Consult with a tax professional to optimize your real estate investment strategy, considering tax implications and potential deductions.

**Investment Options:**

1. **Primary Residence:**
	* Consider purchasing a primary residence in a desirable neighborhood or area with good schools.
	* Aim for a property with a price tag between $150,000 and $250,000.
2. **Rental Property:**
	* Invest in a duplex or a single-family home with a rental income potential of $800-$1,200 per month.
	* Consider investing in a property in a up-and-coming neighborhood or area with growing demand.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Short-term (0-6 months):**
	* Maintain current emergency fund and savings rate
	* Reduce mortgage payments by paying off high-interest debt (if applicable)
2. **Medium-term (6-12 months):**
	* Increase real estate investment allocation to $1,200/month
	* Continue to build emergency fund
3. **Long-term (1-5 years):**
	* Expand real estate portfolio to 2-3 properties
	* Focus on long-term appreciation and rental income growth

**Conclusion:**

This conservative investment strategy will help you maintain an emergency fund while building passive income through real estate investment. By allocating $1,200/month towards real estate investment, you can grow your wealth over time and create a stable financial future for yourself and your daughter.
