**Opportunity Rating:** HIGH Impact + EASY Implementation

The introduction of holistic resilience, narrative coaching, and systems thinking perspectives has significantly enhanced Matthew's plan. By prioritizing mental well-being, clarifying his personal story, and analyzing complex relationships between his goals and objectives, Matthew can create a comprehensive approach that addresses his financial, personal, and professional objectives.

**Financial Projection:**

* Investment Required: $X (estimated)
