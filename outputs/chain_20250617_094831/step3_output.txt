As the Guitar Tone Architect for Mirador, I'll dive deeper into specific settings, signal chains, and techniques for achieving professional guitar tones across various genres.

**Metal Tones (Modern and Classic)**

For modern metal tones:

* Amp Settings:
	+ Gain: 7-8/10
	+ Bass: 5-6/10
	+ Mids: 4-5/10

* Effects Chain:
	+ Overdrive/Distortion: Boss DS-1 or Tube Screamer (Gain at 7-8)
	+ High-pass Filter: 100 Hz to 200 Hz cutoff
	+ Reverb: Small room with 20% decay time
* Signal Chain:
	+ Guitar → Overdrive/Distortion → Gain → Amp → EQ → Compressor → Master Bus

For classic metal tones:

	+ Overdrive/Distortion: Tube Screamer (Gain at 8) or Pro Co RAT
	+ High-pass Filter: 100 Hz to 200 Hz cutoff
	+ Reverb: Large room with 30% decay time
* Signal Chain:
	+ Guitar → Overdrive/Distortion → Gain → Amp → EQ → Compressor → Master Bus

**Rock (Indie to Hard Rock)**

For indie rock tones:

	+ Gain: 5-6/10
	+ Bass: 4-5/10
	+ Mids: 3-4/10
	+ Treble: 5-6/10
* Effects Chain:
	+ Overdrive/Distortion: Boss BD-2 or Fulltone OCD (Gain at 5)
	+ High-pass Filter: 100 Hz to 200 Hz cutoff
	+ Reverb: Small room with 20% decay time
* Signal Chain:
	+ Guitar → Overdrive/Distortion → Gain → Amp → EQ → Compressor → Master Bus

For hard rock tones:

* Amp Settings:
	+ Gain: 7-8/10
	+ Bass: 5-6/10
	+ Mids: 4-5/10
	+ Treble: 6-7/10
* Effects Chain:
	+ Overdrive/Distortion: Pro Co RAT or MXR Distortion+
	+ High-pass Filter: 100 Hz to 200 Hz cutoff
	+ Reverb: Large room with 30% decay time
* Signal Chain:
	+ Guitar → Overdrive/Distortion → Gain → Amp → EQ → Compressor → Master Bus

**Clean Tones for Session Work**

For clean tones:

* Amp Settings:
	+ Gain: 2-3/10
	+ Bass: 3-4/10
	+ Mids: 2-3/10
	+ Treble: 4-5/10
* Effects Chain:
	+ No Overdrive/Distortion
	+ High-pass Filter: 100 Hz to 200 Hz cutoff
	+ Reverb: Small room with 20% decay time
* Signal Chain:
	+ Guitar → Gain → Amp → EQ → Compressor → Master Bus

**Effects Pedal Combinations**

Some popular effects pedal combinations:

* Overdrive/Distortion + Reverb: Great for creating a natural, ambient sound.
* Delay + Reverb: Excellent for adding depth and width to your tone.
* Compression + EQ: Ideal for even out your tone and add punch.

**Amp Simulation Optimization**

To optimize amp simulations:

* Choose the right amp model: Select an amp that matches your desired tone and genre.
* Adjust gain and bass: Boost or cut the gain and bass to achieve a balanced sound.
* Experiment with cab emulations: Try different cab models to find one that suits your tone.

**Recording Techniques**

For recording tones:

* Use a high-quality microphone: Choose a mic that captures your tone accurately, such as a dynamic or condenser mic.
* Monitor your tone: Listen to your tone in real-time to make adjustments during the recording process.
* Record with a clear signal chain: Keep your signal chain clean and minimal to avoid noise and distortion.

**Budget-Conscious Gear Recommendations**

For budget-friendly options:

* Amps:
	+ Fender Mustang III (around $200)
	+ Blackstar ID:Core (around $150)
* Effects Pedals:
	+ Boss DS-1 Distortion ($60)
	+ Fulltone OCD Overdrive ($100)
* Guitars:
	+ Epiphone Les Paul Special II (around $300)
	+ Squier Stratocaster (around $200)

By following these guidelines, you'll be able to achieve professional guitar tones that suit your genre and style. Remember to experiment and find the right settings for your unique tone.
