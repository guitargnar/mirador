As a single father with limited time and energy, maintaining progress on your AI innovation goals requires intentional planning and prioritization:

**Schedule Realism:**
1. **AI work during non-custody time**: Focus on development when your child is with their other parent
2. **Short daily sessions (90-120 minutes)**: Use these focused blocks to make meaningful progress

**Time Management Strategies:**
1. **Batch Similar Tasks**: Group similar tasks, like coding or data analysis, and complete them during designated time slots.
2. **Batch Breaks**: Schedule regular breaks to recharge and avoid burnout
3. **Prioritize Energy-Expensive Tasks**: Allocate your most energetic periods for high-priority tasks

**Child-Friendly AI Collaboration:**
1. **Involve your child in AI-related activities**: Share projects, explain concepts, and foster their curiosity (e.g., coding with visual tools)
2. **Teach problem-solving skills through AI**: Engage your child in solving simple problems or games using AI-powered tools

**Custody Time Optimizations:**
1. **Utilize custody time for learning**: Take advantage of morning routines, naptime, or evening quiet hours for focused work
2. **Use 'Stop-Start' technique**: When feeling exhausted, pause your work and resume when your energy levels increase
