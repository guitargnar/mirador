Based on your specified income of $75,000, I'll calculate the potential Return on Investment (ROI) for wellness investments.

**Assumptions:**

* Gym membership: $50/month
* Nutrition program: $100/month
* Preventive health measures (e.g., bi-annual check-ups, vaccinations): $200/year
* Average annual increase in income due to improved well-being: 3%
* Inflation rate: 2%

**Calculations:**

1. **Gym Membership ROI:**
	* Monthly cost: $50
	* Annual cost: $600
	* Potential annual savings on healthcare costs (assuming a 10% reduction): $60
	* Estimated annual increase in income due to improved physical health: $2,250 (3% of $75,000)
	* ROI calculation:
		+ ($2,250 - $60) / $600 = 0.375 or 37.5%
	* Payback period: approximately 1.6 years
2. **Nutrition Program ROI:**
	* Monthly cost: $100
	* Annual cost: $1,200
	* Potential annual savings on healthcare costs (assuming a 10% reduction): $120
	* Estimated annual increase in income due to improved nutrition and overall well-being: $2,250 (3% of $75,000)
	* ROI calculation:
		+ ($2,250 - $120) / $1,200 = 0.375 or 37.5%
	* Payback period: approximately 3.2 years
3. **Preventive Health Measures ROI:**
	* Annual cost: $200
	* Potential annual savings on healthcare costs (assuming a 10% reduction): $20
	* Estimated annual increase in income due to improved preventive care and overall well-being: $225 (3% of $75,000)
	* ROI calculation:
		+ ($225 - $20) / $200 = 0.125 or 12.5%
	* Payback period: approximately 1.6 years

**Total Wellness Investment ROI:**
Combining the individual ROIs, we get:

* Total annual savings on healthcare costs: $180 (10% reduction)
* Estimated total annual increase in income due to improved well-being: $4,625 (3% of $75,000 + $2,250 from gym membership and nutrition program)
* Total ROI calculation:
	+ ($4,625 - $180) / $1,200 = 0.375 or 37.5%
* Payback period: approximately 3.2 years

**Conclusion:**
Based on your specified income of $75,000, investing in a gym membership, nutrition program, and preventive health measures can potentially yield an ROI of 37.5% over the payback period of approximately 3.2 years. This translates to estimated annual savings of $180 on healthcare costs and an additional $4,625 increase in income due to improved overall well-being.
