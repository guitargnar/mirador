* Communicate with your daughter's school and band about your schedule to ensure you're meeting expectations.
* Prioritize self-care and take breaks when needed to avoid burnout.

**Financial Considerations**

* Allocate 10% of your income towards savings (around $800/month)
* Use the remaining 90% for expenses, including:
	+ Household expenses (rent, utilities, groceries)
	+ Transportation costs
	+ Entertainment and hobbies
	+ Savings and investments

This schedule allows you to balance your work, music practice, AI innovation work, and household responsibilities while ensuring quality time with your daughter. Remember to be flexible and adjust the schedule as needed to accommodate any unexpected events or changes in your priorities.
