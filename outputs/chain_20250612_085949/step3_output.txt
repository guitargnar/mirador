**DECISION:** To implement effective prompt engineering strategies that leverage patient-centered language, interdisciplinary collaboration, and real-world evidence to optimize AI-powered decision-making in healthcare.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Patient-Centered Language**: Implement a comprehensive review of existing medical terminology and replace it with patient-centric terms, ensuring accurate and relevant results.
2. **Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Establish an interdisciplinary task force comprising clinicians, researchers, and patients to develop effective prompts that integrate multiple perspectives.
3. **Real-World Evidence**: Integrate real-world evidence into prompts using machine learning algorithms to analyze and optimize RWE-based prompts.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Option 1 - Patient-Centered Language
- Improves accuracy by ensuring results are relevant to individual patient needs.
- Enhances patient satisfaction through more personalized and empathetic responses.
- Facilitates collaboration with patients and clinicians to refine prompts.

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Conduct a thorough review of existing medical terminology (Weeks 1-4).
□ Collaborate with patients and clinicians to identify key terms and phrases (Weeks 5-8).
□ Integrate patient-centered language into new prompts (Weeks 9-12).

**WATCH FOR:**
⚠️ Insufficient patient input may lead to irrelevant or inaccurate results.
⚠️ Failure to incorporate patient-centered language may result in decreased patient satisfaction.
