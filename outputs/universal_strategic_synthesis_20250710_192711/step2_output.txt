What a fascinating case study! As a universal strategy architect, I'll analyze this situation through multiple strategic lenses, highlighting connections to broader strategic frameworks and identifying systemic implications.

**Strategic Lenses:**

1. **Organizational Development**: This transition requires understanding Humana's innovation culture, identifying key stakeholders, and building executive connections. This aligns with the concept of "Organizational Change Management" (OCM), which involves creating a shared understanding of change among stakeholders and facilitating their engagement.
2. **Innovation Ecosystem**: The scenario highlights the importance of assessing current innovations, leveraging risk management expertise, and developing a compelling value proposition. This resonates with the "Innovation Ecosystem" framework, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of various stakeholders, capabilities, and resources.
3. **Personal Branding and Storytelling**: Crafting a compelling elevator pitch, establishing a personal brand, and reframing feedback are essential for success in this transition. These strategies align with the principles of "Personal Branding" and "Storytelling," which can help amplify one's message and build credibility.
4. **Systems Thinking**: This scenario illustrates the need to consider the broader systemic implications of the transition, including the gradual implementation of Mirador's value proposition and the importance of resilience in the face of rejection. This aligns with the Systems Thinking approach, which involves analyzing complex systems as interconnected components and considering the long-term consequences of decisions.

**Interconnections and Systemic Implications:**

1. **Innovation Culture**: Humana's innovation culture can be a critical factor in determining the success of Mirador's adoption. Understanding and leveraging this culture can help build executive connections and facilitate the transition.
2. **Risk Management Expertise**: As a risk management expert, you bring a unique perspective to innovation initiatives. This expertise can help mitigate risks associated with adopting new technologies like Mirador and drive business growth.
3. **Personal Branding and Storytelling**: Effective personal branding and storytelling can amplify your message, build credibility, and establish trust with stakeholders. This, in turn, can facilitate the transition and increase the likelihood of successful adoption.
4. **Gradual Transition Strategy**: The gradual implementation of Mirador's value proposition can help build momentum, reduce risk, and increase the chances of successful adoption. This approach aligns with the principles of "Change Management" and "Innovation Adoption."

**Actionable Business/Life Strategies:**

1. **Develop a comprehensive understanding of Humana's innovation culture**: Research existing initiatives, identify key stakeholders, and assess the alignment between Mirador's value proposition and the organization's goals.
2. **Leverage your risk management expertise to drive innovation**: Highlight the relevance of AI-driven insights in improving risk management processes and demonstrate how Mirador can support business growth and innovation.
3. **Establish a personal brand and develop a compelling narrative**: Craft a clear elevator pitch, establish a personal brand, and share your transformation story as proof of concept.
4. **Implement a gradual transition strategy**: Offer Mirador as a proof-of-concept or pilot project, demonstrate value through tangible results and ROI analysis, and expand the scope of the initiative over time.
5. **Foster resilience in the face of rejection**: Develop a growth mindset, view rejections as opportunities to refine your approach, and reframe feedback to improve Mirador's value proposition.

By adopting these strategies and considering the broader systemic implications, you can increase the chances of successful transition into an enterprise innovation role and drive meaningful impact at Humana.
