Based on your specified income of $75,000, I'll provide a comprehensive multi-generational wealth-building strategy that incorporates trusts, education funding, and legacy planning.

**Income Confirmation:**
Based on your specified income of $75,000, we will focus on creating a sustainable wealth plan for your family.

**Budget Framework:**
To start, let's allocate 50% of your income towards necessary expenses (housing, food, utilities, transportation), 30% towards discretionary spending (entertainment, hobbies, travel), and 20% towards saving and debt repayment.

**Wealth-Building Objectives:**

1. Create a trust to manage and distribute wealth across generations.
2. Establish an education fund for your children's future expenses.
3. Develop a legacy plan to ensure the long-term preservation of your family's values and assets.

**Trust Strategy:**
Consider establishing a revocable living trust (RLT) to hold and distribute your assets. This will provide flexibility and control during your lifetime, while also ensuring that your wishes are carried out after your passing.

* **Benefits:** Avoid probate, minimize taxes, and maintain control over asset distribution.
* **Costs:** Annual fees for trust administration and maintenance.

**Education Funding:**
Create a dedicated education fund to support your children's future expenses. Consider the following options:

* **529 College Savings Plan:** A tax-advantaged plan that helps save for higher education expenses.
* **Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA):** A type of savings account designed specifically for education expenses.

* **Benefits:** Tax-free growth and withdrawals, flexible contribution limits.
* **Costs:** Annual fees for plan administration and maintenance.

**Legacy Planning:**
Develop a legacy plan to ensure the long-term preservation of your family's values and assets. Consider the following:

* **Family Governance Document:** Establish a document that outlines your family's values, goals, and expectations for future generations.
* **Charitable Giving:** Create a charitable giving strategy to support causes that align with your family's values.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Consult with an attorney or trust expert to establish the RLT and education fund.
2. Open a 529 College Savings Plan or Coverdell ESA to start saving for education expenses.
3. Develop a Family Governance Document and charitable giving strategy.
4. Review and update your estate plan annually to ensure it remains aligned with your family's changing needs.
