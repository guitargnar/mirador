## Step 2: financial_planning_expert_v6 (execution time: 00:33)

**Matthew's 10-Year Financial Plan: A Comprehensive Review**

Based on your specified income of $100,000 per year, I've reviewed and expanded upon the original plan to ensure a more comprehensive and tailored approach for achieving family security while pursuing creative ventures.

**Year 1-3: Establishing a Foundation (Income: $75,000)**

To begin, let's revisit the initial budgeting framework:

1. **Budgeting:** Allocate 50% for essential expenses (housing, food, utilities), 30% for discretionary spending, and 20% for savings and debt repayment.
2. **Savings:** Target 10% of income ($7,500) for emergency fund and short-term goals.
3. **Debt Repayment:** Prioritize high-interest debts, aiming to pay off within 2-3 years.
4. **Investments:** Allocate 5% of income ($3,750) towards a tax-advantaged retirement account (e.g., 401(k), IRA).
5. **Creative Venture:** Start small, allocating $1,000 per month for a part-time music-related project or hobby.

Considering the increased income in Year 4 and beyond, I recommend adjusting these allocations:

* Increase savings to 12% of income ($12,000) to build a more substantial emergency fund.
* Allocate an additional 2% of income ($2,000) towards debt repayment to accelerate high-interest debt elimination.
* Maintain investment allocation at 5% of income ($5,000), but consider diversifying into tax-efficient strategies like Roth IRAs or real estate investing.

**Year 4-6: Expanding Income Streams (Income: $80,000)**

With the increased income, we can explore additional opportunities:

1. **Side Hustles:** Develop and monetize skills through freelance work, teaching, or consulting ($5,000 - $10,000/month).
2. **Investments:** Increase investment allocation to 10% of income ($8,000), exploring low-risk options like index funds or real estate investment trusts (REITs).
3. **Savings:** Maintain emergency fund and short-term goals, aiming for a 6-month cushion.
4. **Debt Repayment:** Continue high-interest debt repayment while exploring lower-interest alternatives.
5. **Creative Venture:** Increase part-time project funding to $2,000/month, exploring opportunities for collaboration or sponsorship.

To further diversify income streams, consider:

* Renting out a spare room on Airbnb (approximately $500 - $1,000/month)
* Selling products online through platforms like Etsy or eBay
* Offering pet-sitting or house-sitting services

**Year 7-9: Accelerating Growth (Income: $90,000)**

As income increases, we can explore more substantial opportunities:

1. **Mainstreaming Creative Venture:** Develop a more substantial music-related business, potentially generating $20,000 - $50,000/month.
2. **Diversified Income Streams:** Explore additional freelance work, teaching, or consulting opportunities ($10,000 - $30,000/month).
3. **Investments:** Increase investment allocation to 15% of income ($13,500), considering tax-efficient strategies like Roth IRAs or real estate investing.
4. **Savings:** Continue to build emergency fund and short-term goals, aiming for a 12-month cushion.
5. **Debt Repayment:** Focus on lower-interest debt repayment and explore credit score optimization.

To further accelerate growth:

3. **Inheritance Planning:** Consider creating a will, establishing trusts, or exploring other estate planning options.
4. **Creative Venture:** Continue to grow and refine the music-related business, ensuring long-term sustainability.
5. **Family Security:** Focus on maintaining a stable financial foundation for family commitments.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
