2. Develop a minimum viable product (MVP) for our digital products, focusing on quality over feature creep.
3. Establish an online presence through social media, email marketing, and content creation.
4. Utilize local resources, such as the Louisville Metro Government, JCPS, or TARC, to gain insights into the community's needs.
