* Projected monthly sales: $50,000
* Average transaction value: $200
* Gross margin percentage: 30%

**Short-term (0-3 months) Budgeting:**

1. **Initial funding**: Matthew will need to cover the initial start-up costs using personal savings or loans.
2. **Monthly cash flow**: Based on projected sales and expenses, Matthew can expect a negative cash flow of -$8,000 in the first month. This is due to the high initial inventory costs and marketing expenses.

**Mid-term (3-6 months) Budgeting:**

1. **Revenue growth**: As the store gains traction, revenue is expected to increase by 10% each month.
2. **Expense management**: To maintain a positive cash flow, Matthew will need to optimize expenses, such as reducing inventory levels and negotiating better deals with suppliers.

**Long-term (6-12 months) Budgeting:**

1. **Scaling up operations**: As the store expands, Matthew can expect increased revenue and expenses.
2. **Investment in growth**: To maintain a competitive edge, Matthew may need to invest in marketing campaigns, employee training, or new product lines.

**Key financial considerations for Matthew:**

1. **Cash reserves**: Maintain an emergency fund of 3-6 months' worth of operating expenses to ensure business continuity.
2. **Debt management**: Monitor and manage debt levels, including loans and credit card balances, to avoid high interest rates and maintain a healthy credit score.
3. **Tax planning**: Take advantage of Kentucky state income tax deductions for small businesses and explore local tax incentives.

**Implementation steps with local resources:**

1. **Louisville Metro Government**: Utilize the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) for free business consulting, low-cost training, and access to capital.
2. **JCPS**: Partner with Jefferson County Public Schools to offer workshops on music gear maintenance and repair, promoting the store's expertise and building relationships with local musicians.
3. **TARC**: Leverage the Transit Authority of River City (TARC) for transportation costs, reducing operational expenses.

**Professional consultation recommendations:**

1. **Accountant or bookkeeper**: Engage a professional to ensure accurate financial record-keeping, tax planning, and cash flow management.
2. **Business attorney**: Consult with an attorney specializing in small business law to review contracts, negotiate deals, and protect the store's interests.
3. **Marketing expert**: Collaborate with a marketing specialist to develop targeted advertising campaigns, social media strategies, and promotional materials.
