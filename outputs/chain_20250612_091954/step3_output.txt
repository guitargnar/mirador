**DECISION:** Implement a multimodal prompt engineering framework to enhance model performance on tasks that require visual or auditory cues.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Implement Multimodal Prompting**: Incorporate images, audio, or videos into the prompt engineering process to improve model performance.
2. **Optimize Prompt Chain**: Analyze and adjust the sequence of prompts to maximize information transfer between consecutive steps.
3. **Integrate Emotional Intelligence**: Consider emotional tone and nuances in input data to create more empathetic and human-like responses.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Implement Multimodal Prompting
- Enhances model performance on tasks requiring visual or auditory cues
- Improves overall prompt effectiveness by leveraging diverse input modalities
- Facilitates the development of more nuanced and empathetic responses

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Develop a multimodal prompt engineering framework (Weeks 1-4)
□ Integrate image and audio inputs into the model training process (Weeks 5-8)
□ Continuously evaluate and refine the prompt engineering strategy based on user feedback and emerging trends

**WATCH FOR:**
⚠️ Overfitting to multimodal data, requiring regularization techniques and careful hyperparameter tuning
⚠️ Underfitting due to insufficient training data or inadequate model complexity, necessitating additional data or more complex models
