**Additional Insights and Suggestions**

Based on the provided context and previous analysis, I'd like to offer the following additional perspectives and suggestions:

1. **Emphasize Business Value**: When discussing AI adoption with stakeholders, focus on the business value it can bring, such as improved accuracy, reduced manual effort, and cost savings. Use concrete examples and metrics to demonstrate the potential ROI.
2. **Address Technical Overhead**: Acknowledge the technical constraints imposed by Humana's oversight layer and discuss potential workarounds or solutions that could mitigate these limitations.
3. **Foster Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration between different teams and stakeholders to ensure a cohesive approach to AI adoption. This can include establishing cross-functional working groups, sharing knowledge, and learning from each other's experiences.
4. **Develop a Clear Communication Strategy**: Create a clear communication plan to ensure that key stakeholders are informed about the progress, challenges, and successes of the AI adoption initiative. This will help build trust, manage expectations, and facilitate feedback.
5. **Leverage Employee Networks**: Tap into employee networks and encourage word-of-mouth recommendations to drive adoption. This can include internal ambassadors or champions who can share their experiences and promote the benefits of AI-powered tools and platforms.
6. **Prioritize Transparency and Feedback**: Ensure that stakeholders are informed about the data collection, model development, and testing processes. Provide regular feedback mechanisms to ensure that concerns are addressed and the solution meets business requirements.
7. **Explore Alternative Solutions**: Consider exploring alternative solutions or approaches that can help overcome technical constraints or bureaucratic hurdles. This might involve partnering with external vendors, developing custom solutions, or finding innovative ways to work around existing limitations.
