**Decision:** Implement asynchronous Python for AI applications to improve performance and throughput.

**OPTIONS:**

1.  **Task-based concurrency with asyncio.gather**: Use tasks to represent concurrent model inferences and run them simultaneously using `asyncio.gather`.
2.  **Input data parallelism with NumPy**: Process input data in parallel using NumPy's vectorized operations.
3.  **Model parallelism with PyTorch**: Run multiple models concurrently using PyTorch's distributed training capabilities.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Implement task-based concurrency with `asyncio.gather`.

-   **Improved resource utilization**: Task-based concurrency allows for better resource utilization, reducing the risk of overloading the system.
-   **Enhanced performance**: Running tasks concurrently improves overall system performance and throughput.
-   **Simplified code maintenance**: Using `asyncio.gather` simplifies code maintenance by allowing for easier debugging and optimization.

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Implement task-based concurrency with `asyncio.gather` this week.
□ Optimize input data processing using NumPy's vectorized operations next 2 weeks.
□ Refactor existing code to use async/await syntax this month.

**WATCH FOR:**

⚠️ **Overloading the system**: Be cautious of overloading the system with too many concurrent tasks, which can lead to performance degradation.
⚠️ **Deadlocks and synchronization issues**: Be aware of potential deadlocks and synchronization issues that can arise when using task-based concurrency.
