# ðŸ”’ Repository Security Cleanup Complete

## What Happened
On July 9, 2025, this repository underwent a security cleanup to remove sensitive financial and company-specific data. The Git history has been rewritten to permanently remove these files.

## For Collaborators
**IMPORTANT**: Due to the history rewrite, you must:

1. **Delete your local clone**:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   rm -rf mirador
   ```

2. **Re-clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guitargnar/mirador.git
   cd mirador
   ```

3. **If you have local branches**, save any important work first, then recreate branches from the new history.
