# Mirador Optimization Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Model Consoli## Phase 1: Model Consolidation Strategy and Implementation
- [x] Audit existing 56+ models and their performance metrics
- [x] Identify redundant and underperforming model versions
- [x] Create consolidation mapping strategy
- [x] Implement model deprecation and migration plan
- [x] Generate model performance comparison report
- [x] Create automated model testing framework
- [x] Develop consolidation scripts and tools
- [x] Update configuration files and documentationtion

## Phase 2: Base Model Migration and Configuration Updates

### Migration Tasks
