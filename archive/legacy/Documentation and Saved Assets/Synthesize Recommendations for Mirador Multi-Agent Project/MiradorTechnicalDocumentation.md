## Architecture Overview

### System Design Philosophy

Mirador implements a distributed AI orchestration architecture that prioritizes specialist collaboration over monolithic intelligence. This design philosophy recognizes that complex personal life decisions require multiple domains of expertise working in coordination rather than attempting to solve all problems with a single general-purpose model.

The architecture separates concerns between domain expertise, strategic analysis, and local knowledge integration. Each specialist model focuses on a specific area of competency while the orchestration framework manages collaboration, handoffs, and result synthesis. This separation enables targeted optimization of each component while maintaining system coherence.

The framework operates entirely within the local computing environment, ensuring complete privacy and control over sensitive personal information. All processing occurs through local Ollama models without external API dependencies, providing enterprise-grade security for personal use cases.

### Core Components

The Mirador system consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide comprehensive personal life automation capabilities. Understanding these components and their interactions is essential for system administration, troubleshooting, and optimization.

**Ollama Runtime Environment:** Serves as the foundation for all AI model execution, providing the interface between Mirador's orchestration framework and the underlying language models. Ollama manages model loading, memory allocation, and execution scheduling, ensuring efficient resource utilization across multiple concurrent model operations.

**Mirador-EZ Command Interface:** Provides the primary user interface for system interaction, abstracting the complexity of model orchestration behind simple command patterns. The interface handles request routing, chain orchestration, output management, and error handling, presenting a unified experience regardless of the underlying model complexity.

**Specialist Model Collection:** Comprises the domain-specific AI models that provide specialized expertise in financial planning, local resource integration, and strategic analysis. Each model is optimized for specific use cases and collaboration patterns, with parameters tuned for reliable performance in chain contexts.

**Chain Orchestration Engine:** Manages the execution of multi-model chains, handling model sequencing, context passing, and result synthesis. The engine ensures that each model in a chain receives appropriate context from previous models while maintaining coherent analysis flow.

**Output Management System:** Organizes and stores the results of individual queries and chain executions, providing structured access to historical analysis and enabling long-term reference and pattern identification.

**Version Control Integration:** Maintains comprehensive tracking of system configuration, model definitions, and development history, enabling safe experimentation and reliable rollback capabilities.

### Model Architecture

Each specialist model in the Mirador system follows a consistent architectural pattern that optimizes for both individual performance and chain collaboration. Understanding this architecture enables effective model development, optimization, and troubleshooting.

**Base Model Foundation:** All specialist models build upon the llama3.2_balanced foundation, which provides reliable performance characteristics and proven compatibility with chain orchestration requirements. This consistent foundation ensures predictable behavior and resource requirements across all specialists.

**Parameter Optimization:** Model parameters are carefully tuned to balance response quality with execution speed, ensuring that chains complete within acceptable timeframes while maintaining analytical depth. Temperature settings optimize for focused analysis, while token limits ensure comprehensive responses without excessive verbosity.

**System Prompt Engineering:** Each model includes sophisticated system prompts that define expertise domains, response structures, and collaboration protocols. These prompts ensure consistent output quality and enable effective handoffs between models in chain contexts.

**Local Knowledge Integration:** Models incorporate specific knowledge about Louisville, Kentucky, and Jefferson County, providing guidance that accounts for local regulations, market conditions, and available resources. This integration distinguishes Mirador from generic AI systems.

### Data Flow Architecture

Understanding Mirador's data flow architecture is essential for optimizing performance, troubleshooting issues, and developing new capabilities. The system implements a structured approach to information processing that ensures consistency and reliability.

**Input Processing:** User requests are processed through the mirador-ez interface, which handles request parsing, model selection, and parameter configuration. The interface validates inputs and structures them appropriately for the selected models or chain patterns.

**Model Execution:** Individual models receive structured inputs and generate responses according to their specialized capabilities and system prompts. Execution occurs within the Ollama runtime environment, which manages resource allocation and performance optimization.

**Chain Coordination:** For multi-model chains, the orchestration engine manages the sequential execution of models, passing context and results between models while maintaining coherent analysis flow. Each model builds upon previous analysis while contributing unique expertise.

**Output Synthesis:** Chain results are synthesized into comprehensive summaries that integrate insights from all participating models. The synthesis process identifies key recommendations, strategic insights, and actionable next steps.

**Result Storage:** All outputs are stored in structured directories with metadata that enables efficient retrieval and analysis. The storage system maintains both individual model outputs and synthesized chain results for comprehensive reference.
