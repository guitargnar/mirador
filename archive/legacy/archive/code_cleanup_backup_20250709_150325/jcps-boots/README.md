## 🌟 The Story

Every parent wants the best for their child. But what happens when the system assigns your 8-year-old to a school with **6-9% math proficiency**? 

This project began with a simple, urgent question:

> *"My daughter has been placed in Shelby Academy Elementary for second grade. What do I do?"*

What started as one parent's crisis became a powerful tool for any family navigating the complex world of school transfers. Like standing at a crossroads in the desert, sometimes the path forward isn't clear - but with the right tools and determination, you can find your way.

## 🚀 From Problem to Solution
