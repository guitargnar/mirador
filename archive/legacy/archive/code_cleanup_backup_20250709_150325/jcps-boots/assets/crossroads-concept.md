# Crossroads Banner Concept

## Visual Metaphor
The crossroads image from the desert represents the moment of decision every parent faces when confronted with their child's educational future. 

### Design Elements:
- **Two paths diverging** - Current school vs. better opportunities
- **Desert setting** - The feeling of isolation and uncertainty
- **Street signs** - "SAGE CT" and "SAGE AVE" symbolize wisdom and different paths to the same goal
- **Clear blue sky** - Hope and possibility ahead
- **Sparse landscape** - The journey may seem daunting but the path is clear

### Color Palette:
- Desert tones (sand, sage green)
- Sky blue (hope, clarity)
- White/cream (possibility)
- Green street signs (growth, positive direction)

### Text Overlay:
"When you find yourself at the intersection of what is and what could be"

This image should be created as a banner (1200x400px) with the crossroads prominently featured and subtle text overlay.
