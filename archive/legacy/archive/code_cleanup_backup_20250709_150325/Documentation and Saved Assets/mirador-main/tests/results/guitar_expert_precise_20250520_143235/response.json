The user wants it to be progressive, starting from beginner to intermediate levels. They also asked for tablature examples and an explanation of the music theory behind the arpeggios used.\n\nFirst, I should recall what sweep picking is. From what I know, sweep picking involves playing a series of notes across multiple strings with a single pick stroke in one direction—usually down or up. It's commonly used to play arpeggios quickly and smoothly.\n\nArpeggios are broken chords where each note is played sequentially rather than simultaneously. In metal music, especially technical death metal, sweep picking arpeggios is a staple technique for creating fast, flowing melodies.\n\nFor the practice routine, I should structure it in a way that builds up from simpler to more complex exercises. The user mentioned including tablature examples, so I'll need to create those using the standard 6-line format with timing indicators and technique markings like h for hammer-on and p for pull-off.\n\nStarting at the beginner level, I think introducing major and minor arpeggios would be a good foundation. These are common in metal and will help build the necessary muscle memory and coordination.\n\nNext, moving to intermediate, adding diminished and augmented arpeggios can introduce more complexity and different sounds. Also, incorporating string skipping and two-hand tapping can enhance the technical difficulty and musicality.\n\nI should explain the music theory behind each arpeggio type. For example, a major arpeggio consists of the root, third, and fifth notes of a major scale. A minor arpeggio uses the root, minor third, and fifth. Diminished and augmented have their own specific intervals that give them unique sounds.\n\nI also need to make sure each exercise is notated correctly with tabs, showing the sweep picking direction and any hammer-ons or pull-offs used for smooth transitions between notes.\n\nIncluding practice tips like starting slow, using a metronome, focusing on clean sound, and gradually increasing speed will help users effectively build their skills. Additionally, suggesting creative applications beyond the exercises can encourage musical expression.\n\nI should structure each section clearly: beginner with major and minor arpeggios, intermediate with diminished, augmented, string skipping, and two-hand tapping. Each exercise should have a tablature example, explanation of the technique, and theory behind it.\n\nFinally, I'll wrap up with some practice tips to guide users on how to approach these exercises effectively.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n### Sweep Picking Arpeggio Practice Routine for Metal Music\n\nSweep picking is one of the most iconic techniques in metal guitar playing. It allows you to create fluid, melodic lines by moving your pick across multiple strings in a single stroke (down or up). This practice routine will guide you from basic arpeggio shapes to more complex patterns, focusing on building speed, accuracy, and musicality.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Beginner Level: Major and Minor Arpeggios**\n\nStart with the foundational major and minor arpeggios. These are simple, clean shapes that will help you develop proper sweep picking technique and finger coordination.\n\n#### **a) Major Arpeggio (C Major)**\n\n**Theory:** A major arpeggio consists of three notes: root (1), major third (3), and perfect fifth (5). In C major, these notes are C, E, and G.\n\n**Tablature Example (Descending):**\n\n```\ne|-------------------|\nB|-------------------|\nG|-------------------|\nD|---7---9---10------|\nA|---7---9---10------|\nE|-------------------|\n```\n\n**Technique:**  \n- Use a single downstroke to play the three notes on the D and A strings.  \n- Hammer-on (h) from 7 to 9, then hammer-on again to 10.  \n- Pull-off (p) back down the scale after reaching the top note.\n\n**Practice Tips:**  \n- Start slow (e.g., 60 BPM) and focus on clean articulation.  \n- Use a metronome to ensure even timing.  \n\n---\n\n#### **b) Minor Arpeggio (C Minor)**\n\n**Theory:** A minor arpeggio consists of root (1), minor third (♭3), and perfect fifth (5). In C minor, these notes are C, Eb, and G.\n\n**Tablature Example (Ascending):**\n\n```\ne|-------------------|\nB|-------------------|\nG|-------------------|\nD|---8---7---6-------|\nA|---8---7---6-------|\nE|-------------------|\n```\n\n**Technique:**  \n- Use a single upstroke to play the three notes on the D and A strings.  \n- Pull-off from 8 to 7, then pull-off again to 6.  \n\n---\n\n### **2. Intermediate Level: Diminished and Augmented Arpeggios**\n\nMove on to more complex arpeggios with unique harmonic qualities.\n\n#### **a) Diminished Arpeggio (C Diminished)**\n\n**Theory:** A diminished arpeggio consists of root (1), minor third (♭3), and diminished fifth (♭5). In C diminished, these notes are C, Eb, and Gb.\n\n**Tablature Example:**\n\n```\ne|-------------------|\nB|---7---9---10------|\nG|---7---9---10------|\nD|-------------------|\nA|-------------------|\nE|-------------------|\n```\n\n**Technique:**  \n- Use a single downstroke to play the three notes on the B and G strings.  \n- Hammer-on from 7 to 9, then hammer-on again to 10.  \n\n---\n\n#### **b) Augmented Arpeggio (C Augmented)**\n\n**Theory:** An augmented arpeggio consists of root (1), major third (3), and augmented fifth (#5). In C augmented, these notes are C, E, and G#.\n\n**Tablature Example:**\n\n```\ne|---8---7---6-------|\nB|-------------------|\nG|-------------------|\nD|-------------------|\nA|-------------------|\nE|-------------------|\n```\n\n**Technique:**  \n- Use a single upstroke to play the three notes on the e string.  \n- Pull-off from 8 to 7, then pull-off again to 6.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Intermediate Level: String Skipping and Two-Hand Tapping**\n\nTo add complexity and variety to your sweeps, incorporate string skipping and two-hand tapping.\n\n#### **a) String-Skipping Arpeggio (C Major)**\n\n**Theory:** This pattern uses the same notes as a C major arpeggio but skips strings for a more dynamic sound.\n\n**Tablature Example:**\n\n```\ne|---10--8---|\nB|-----------|\nG|---9-------|\nD|-----------|\nA|---7-------|\nE|-----------|\n```\n\n**Technique:**  \n- Use alternate picking (down, up, down) to play the notes on non-consecutive strings.  \n- Hammer-on from 7 to 9 and pull-off from 10 back down.  \n\n---\n\n#### **b) Two-Hand Tapping Arpeggio (C Minor)**\n\n**Theory:** This pattern combines sweep picking with two-hand tapping for a virtuosic effect.\n\n**Tablature Example:**\n\n```\ne|-------------------|\nB|---7---9---10------|\nG|---7---9---10------|\nD|-------------------|\nA|-------------------|\nE|-------------------|\n```\n\n**Technique:**  \n- Tap the notes on the B and G strings with your right hand.  \n- Use hammer-ons (h) and pull-offs (p) to create a smooth legato sound.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Practice Tips**\n\n1. **Start Slow:** Begin at 60 BPM and gradually increase speed as you master each pattern.\n2. **Use a Metronome:** Ensure your timing is consistent and avoid rushing.\n3. **Focus on Clean Sound:** Avoid muting or buzzing strings—use proper finger placement.\n4. **Practice Both Hands:** Alternate between ascending and descending patterns to develop balanced technique.\n5. **Record Yourself:** Listen back to identify areas for improvement.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Creative Applications**\n\n- Use these arpeggios as melodic fills in your solos.  \n- Experiment with different rhythms (e.g., syncopation, triplets).  \n- Combine sweeps with other techniques like legato phrasing or tapping.  \n\nBy following this routine, you'll develop the skills to incorporate sweep picking into your playing and create dynamic, technical metal guitar
