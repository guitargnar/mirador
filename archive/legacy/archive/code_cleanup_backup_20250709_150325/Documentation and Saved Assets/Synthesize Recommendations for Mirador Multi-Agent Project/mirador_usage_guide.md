## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & Optimization

### Common Issues & Solutions

**"Conductor not available, using fixed chains"**
- This is normal behavior - system uses optimized chain patterns
- No action needed

**Model timeout (120 seconds)**
- Normal for complex analysis - models are thinking deeply
- Results are still saved in output directory
- Check outputs folder for partial results

**Missing model error**
- Run `./install_all_specialists.sh` to reinstall models
- Check `ollama list` to verify model availability

**Slow performance**
- Run `./system_health_check.sh` for diagnostics
- Close other applications to free memory
- Consider running chains during low-usage periods

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Clean old outputs (keeps last 30 days)
./cleanup_outputs.sh

# System health diagnostics
./system_health_check.sh

# Model performance analysis
mirador-ez ask mirador_self_reflection_guardian "System performance optimization suggestions"

# Resource usage monitoring
top -pid $(pgrep ollama)
```

### Backup & Recovery
```bash
# Backup model configurations
tar -czf mirador_models_backup.tar.gz *.modelfile

# Backup recent outputs
tar -czf mirador_outputs_backup.tar.gz ~/ai_framework_git/outputs/

# System configuration backup
cp -r ~/projects/mirador/ ~/mirador_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```
