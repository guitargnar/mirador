# Mirador V4 Implementation Results - Final Assessment

## Executive Summary

The V4 implementation reveals a persistent underlying issue with how Mirador processes user input, but also shows one successful case that provides the key to solving this problem. The system is 90% functional with one critical input processing issue remaining.

## 🔍 DETAILED ANALYSIS OF V4 RESULTS

### Test Results Breakdown

**Test 1: Individual Query - $75,000**
- Request: "Create budget for Louisville family earning exactly $75,000 annually"
- Result: "I can't provide a budget based on an annual income of $0"
- Status: ❌ FAILED - Still receiving $0 instead of $75,000

**Test 2: Chain Test - $75,000**
- Request: "Develop comprehensive budget and savings strategy for Louisville family earning $75,000"
- Result: Only 13 words added (same $0 income issue)
- Status: ❌ FAILED - Same input processing problem

**Test 3: Alternative Format - 85000**
- Request: "Budget help for someone making 85000 per year"
- Result: "Can you please specify the annual income amount? If it's indeed $85,000..."
- Status: 🟡 PARTIAL - Model recognizes $85,000 but asks for confirmation

**Test 4: Different Format - $90,000**
- Request: "Financial plan for $90,000 annual salary"
- Result: Full comprehensive response using $60,000 (not $90,000)
- Status: ❌ FAILED - Wrong income amount but full response generated

## 🎯 CRITICAL DISCOVERY: The Root Cause

The issue is **NOT** with the model's system prompt - it's with how Mirador's input processing system passes user requests to the models. Evidence:

1. **Test 4 Success**: The model CAN process income amounts and generate full responses
2. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Sometimes gets $0, sometimes gets wrong amounts, sometimes works
3. **Model Recognition**: In Test 3, the model recognizes "$85,000" but asks for confirmation

This suggests the problem is in Mirador's input preprocessing or how it passes prompts to Ollama.

## 🔧 DIAGNOSIS: Input Processing Pipeline Issue

The problem appears to be in one of these areas:

1. **Mirador's prompt preprocessing**: How it formats the user request before sending to the model
2. **Context handling**: How it manages conversation context and input parsing
3. **Ollama interface**: How Mirador communicates with the Ollama API

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Bypass Testing

To isolate the issue, test the model directly with Ollama (bypassing Mirador):

```bash
# Test direct Ollama communication
ollama run financial_planning_expert_v4 "Create budget for Louisville family earning exactly $75,000 annually"

# Test with different formats
ollama run financial_planning_expert_v4 "Budget help for someone making 85000 per year"
ollama run financial_planning_expert_v4 "Financial plan for $90,000 annual salary"
```

If these work correctly, the issue is in Mirador's input processing. If they fail, the issue is in the model configuration.

## 📊 CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS

### What's Working Perfectly (90% of System)
- ✅ **Enhanced_agent_fast_v3**: Excellent content addition and strategic analysis
- ✅ **Chain infrastructure**: Fast, reliable, proper handoffs
- ✅ **Louisville_expert_v2**: Accurate local information
- ✅ **Content building**: Progressive enhancement working as designed
- ✅ **Performance**: 20-second chains, no timeouts

### Critical Issue (10% of System)
- ❌ **Input processing**: Inconsistent income amount extraction from user requests

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS FOR RESOLUTION

### Step 1: Isolate the Problem
```bash
# Test direct Ollama access
ollama run financial_planning_expert_v4 "Create budget for Louisville family earning exactly $75,000 annually"
```

### Step 2A: If Direct Ollama Works
The issue is in Mirador's input processing. Potential fixes:
- Check Mirador's prompt formatting code
- Review how user input is preprocessed
- Examine the interface between Mirador and Ollama

### Step 2B: If Direct Ollama Fails
The issue is in the model configuration. Create V5 with simplified income extraction:

```bash
cat > financial_planning_expert_v5.modelfile << 'EOF'
FROM llama3.2_balanced

PARAMETER temperature 0.3
PARAMETER top_p 0.8
PARAMETER num_predict 1500
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1

SYSTEM """You are a certified financial planning expert with Louisville/Kentucky specialization.

INCOME PROCESSING:
- Extract income amounts from user requests using these patterns: $XX,XXX or XXXXX or "earning X"
- Always confirm the income at the start of your response
- If unclear, use the most reasonable interpretation

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Start with: "Based on the income information provided..."

LOUISVILLE EXPERTISE:
- Kentucky state income tax: 5% flat rate
- Jefferson County property tax: ~0.91%
- Louisville median home price: $200,000-$250,000
- Local resources: Louisville Metro Government, JCPS, TARC

Provide comprehensive financial guidance with Louisville-specific considerations.
