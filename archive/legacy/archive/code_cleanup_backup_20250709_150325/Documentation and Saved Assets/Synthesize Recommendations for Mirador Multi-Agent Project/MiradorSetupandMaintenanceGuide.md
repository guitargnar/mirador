Understanding these advanced configuration options allows users to maximize the value they receive from the system while ensuring optimal performance for their particular environment and workflows.

### Performance Tuning

Performance tuning represents one of the most impactful areas for advanced configuration, as proper tuning can significantly improve response times, resource utilization, and overall system efficiency. The optimized Mirador system provides multiple levels of performance configuration that can be adjusted based on available hardware resources, usage patterns, and performance requirements.

Memory management configuration controls how the system allocates and manages memory resources for model loading, caching, and general operation. Users with abundant memory can configure the system to keep multiple models loaded simultaneously, reducing startup delays for frequently used models. Conversely, users with limited memory can configure more aggressive memory management that dynamically loads and unloads models based on immediate needs.

The memory configuration includes settings for maximum concurrent model loading, which determines how many models can be loaded simultaneously without causing resource exhaustion. This setting should be adjusted based on available system memory and the typical memory requirements of the models being used. Additionally, memory threshold settings control when the system begins unloading less frequently used models to free memory for new operations.

Cache configuration provides another significant opportunity for performance optimization, as intelligent caching can dramatically reduce response times for frequently requested analyses. The cache system includes settings for maximum cache size, cache retention policies, and cache invalidation strategies that can be tuned based on available storage space and usage patterns.

Cache size limits determine how much disk space the system dedicates to storing cached responses. Users with abundant storage can configure larger cache sizes to maximize cache hit rates, while users with limited storage can configure smaller caches with more aggressive cleanup policies. The cache retention policies determine how long cached responses remain valid before being automatically invalidated and removed.

Timeout and retry configuration enables users to balance system responsiveness with reliability based on their specific use cases and tolerance for delays. Users who prioritize speed can configure shorter timeouts and fewer retry attempts, accepting occasional failures in exchange for faster overall response times. Users who prioritize reliability can configure longer timeouts and more retry attempts to maximize the likelihood of successful operation even under challenging conditions.
