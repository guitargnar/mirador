\u003cthink\u003e\nOkay, so I'm trying to create a practice routine for sweep picking arpeggios in metal music. I know that sweep picking is a technique where you play a sequence of notes across multiple strings with a single pick stroke, either down or up. Arpeggios are like broken chords, right? So combining these two should give me those flowing, melodic lines that metal often uses.\n\nFirst, the user wants this routine to progress from beginner to intermediate levels. That means I need to start simple and gradually increase the complexity. Maybe starting with basic triads and moving on to more extended arpeggios like 7th chords or diminished ones.\n\nI should include tablature examples for each step. Using standard tuning, so E-A-D-G-B-e. The tabs should be clear, showing which strings to play and the order of notes. Timing indicators are important too—probably eighth notes or sixteenth notes depending on the speed.\n\nTheoretical explanation is also needed. For each arpeggio type, I need to explain what it is, how it's constructed from a scale, and why it sounds the way it does in metal music. For example, major triads give a bright sound, minor triads are darker, and diminished add tension.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. **Introduction to Sweep Picking**: Start with basic triad arpeggios—major, minor, diminished. These are foundational and will help build muscle memory for the sweeping motion.\n\n2. **Expanding to 7th Arpeggios**: After mastering triads, introduce dominant 7th, major 7th, and minor 7th arpeggios. These add more complexity and different sounds.\n\n3. **String Skipping and Economy Picking**: To make sweeps faster and smoother, incorporate string skipping and economy picking techniques. This might involve alternating pick directions or using hammer-ons and pull-offs.\n\n4. **Combining Arpeggios with Scales**: Finally, integrate arpeggios into scalar patterns to create more intricate melodies. This step should challenge the player to think about how different arpeggios fit within a key or progression.\n\nFor each section, I'll provide tab examples. Let me think of some specific ones:\n\n- **Major Triad Arpeggio**: Starting on E, going up the neck.\n- **Minor Triad Arpeggio**: Maybe starting on A minor for a darker sound.\n- **Diminished Triad Arpeggio**: Could be on B diminished to show tension.\n\nWhen moving to 7th arpeggios, I'll add the seventh note. For example:\n\n- **Dominant 7th**: E7, adding the G#.\n- **Major 7th**: Cmaj7, adding the B.\n- **Minor 7th**: Amin7, adding the G.\n\nIn the string skipping section, maybe a pattern that skips a string to create a wider interval sound. Economy picking would involve using downstrokes and upstrokes efficiently without unnecessary movements.\n\nFinally, combining with scales—perhaps playing an arpeggio and then continuing into a scale for a flowing line. This could be in E minor, mixing the triad arpeggio with the E minor pentatonic or blues scale.\n\nI need to make sure each step builds on the previous one, allowing the player to gradually increase their difficulty. Also, timing indicators should show how fast each part is intended to be played, maybe starting at a moderate tempo and increasing as they get comfortable.\n\nIncluding technique markings like 'sweep' above the arpeggios will help clarify when to use that picking method. Hammer-ons and pull-offs can be added in later steps for economy of movement.\n\nOverall, the routine should be structured, clear, and progressively challenging. Each tab example needs to be accurate so players can follow along without confusion. The theoretical explanations should tie each arpeggio type back to its musical function, helping players understand when and why to use them in their playing.\n\u003c/think\u003e\n\n### Practice Routine: Sweep Picking Arpeggios in Metal Music\n\n#### **1. Introduction to Sweep Picking**\n\n**Objective:** Master basic triad arpeggios (major, minor, diminished) to build foundational sweep picking skills.\n\n**Tablature Examples:**\n\n- **E Major Triad Arpeggio**\n```\ne|----------------|\nB|----------------|\nG|----------------|\nD|----------------|\nA|---0-2-4--------|\nE|---0-----------|\n```\n\n- **A Minor Triad Arpeggio**\n```\ne|----------------|\nB|----------------|\nG|----------------|\nD|---0-2-3--------|\nA|---0-----------|\nE|----------------|\n```\n\n- **B Diminished Triad Arpeggio**\n```\ne|----------------|\nB|----------------|\nG|---1-3----------|\nD|---0-----------|\nA|----------------|\nE|----------------|\n```\n\n**Theoretical Explanation:**\n- **Major Triad:** Constructed from the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of a major scale.
