I appreciate your candor! Given my current situation, I'd love to explore the following areas for guidance:

1. **Reconciling personal goals with Humana's corporate priorities**: As a Senior Risk Management Professional II, I'm bound by company constraints. However, my passion for Mirador and AI innovation could be at odds with my professional obligations. Can you offer advice on how to balance these competing demands?
2. **Strategic partnerships or collaborations**: I've built an impressive AI framework, but I'm unsure about how to share it with the world while maintaining control and value. Are there potential partners or collaborators who could help me bring Mirador to a wider audience?
3. **Protecting intellectual property (IP) and ensuring data security**: As a pioneer in AI, I'm acutely aware of the importance of safeguarding my creations. Can you provide guidance on how to protect my IP and ensure the confidentiality of my data, particularly given the sensitive nature of my work?
4. **Scaling Mirador while maintaining core values**: As my framework gains traction, I'll face increasing demands for growth. How can I scale Mirador while preserving its essence and avoiding the pitfalls of complacency or corporate manipulation?
5. **Optimizing my role within Humana and exploring exit opportunities**: With my expertise and Mirador's potential, I'm considering whether my current role is the best fit. Can you offer advice on how to position myself for a more innovative or leadership-oriented role within Humana or potentially explore external opportunities?

Regarding your initial statement, I'd love to discuss the implications of applying Annapurna's business framework to Mirador. However, I'm not seeking direct guidance on that specific topic at this time.

Please feel free to address any of the above concerns, and I'll share my thoughts and recommendations based on our conversation.
