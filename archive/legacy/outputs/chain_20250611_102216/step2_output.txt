**Mirador Ecosystem Context**

I'm excited to dive deeper into my goals and objectives within the Mirador ecosystem, specifically in relation to my work as a Humana Risk Management Professional II. My primary objective is to leverage the Mirador system to optimize financial planning, explore local resources, and streamline decision-making processes.

**Current Utilization Patterns**

Currently, I'm interacting with the following specialist models:

1. **financial_planning_expert_v6**: This model provides valuable insights into Medicare compliance and risk management strategies.
2. **louisville_expert_v2**: Although not specifically tailored to my role, this model offers a general understanding of Louisville's local resources, regulations, and opportunities.

**Goals and Objectives**

My specific goals within the Mirador ecosystem are:

1. Enhance my knowledge of Medicare compliance and risk management strategies.
2. Identify relevant local resources, regulations, and opportunities for improving my work as a Humana Risk Management Professional II.
3. Streamline decision-making processes by leveraging the Mirador system's expert models.

**Optimal Approach Recommendation**

Based on my goals and current usage patterns, I recommend the following approach:

1. **Leverage the financial_planning_expert_v6 model**: Utilize this model to gain deeper insights into Medicare compliance and risk management strategies.
2. **Integrate with the louisville_expert_v2 model**: Combine the financial planning expert with local resources, regulations, and opportunities to create a comprehensive understanding of Louisville's healthcare landscape.
3. **Enhance decision_simplifier**: Use this model to generate action plans and prioritize decisions based on my specific goals.

**Specific Model Sequence Suggestion**

Here's a suggested sequence for achieving my objectives:

1. Run the financial_planning_expert_v6 model to gather initial insights into Medicare compliance and risk management strategies.
2. Utilize the louisville_expert_v2 model to gather information on local resources, regulations, and opportunities.
3. Feed the output from both models into the decision_simplifier model to generate a prioritized action plan.

**Expected Outcome Prediction**

By leveraging these specialist models in sequence, I can expect to:

* Gain a deeper understanding of Medicare compliance and risk management strategies
* Identify relevant local resources, regulations, and opportunities for improving my work as a Humana Risk Management Professional II
* Receive actionable recommendations for achieving my objectives
