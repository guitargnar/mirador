Considering Matthew's background in music and guitar, let's tailor the focus to his creative and collaborative nature while ensuring he's well-prepared for touring.

**Touring Readiness Guitar Skills Focus:**

1. **Instrumental Familiarity:** Refocus on becoming intimately familiar with your instrument, including its unique tone, sustain, and capabilities.
2. **Song-Specific Learning:** Instead of learning a wide range of songs, focus on mastering 3-5 essential tracks for the tour. This will allow you to develop a deeper understanding of your part in each song and improve overall performance.
3. **Riff-Based Repertoire:** Develop a solid foundation in iconic riffs from various genres, including rock, pop, and folk. This will enable you to adapt quickly to new songs and performances.
4. **Chord Progressions:** Focus on common chord progressions used in popular music, such as I-V-vi-IV or ii-V-I. Mastering these progressions will help you navigate different song structures and genres.
5. **Sight-Singing:** Practice sight-singing exercises to improve your ability to learn new songs quickly and accurately. This skill will also benefit you when improvising or making adjustments during performances.

**Touring-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Stage Presence:** Work on developing a more energetic stage presence, including movement, gestures, and interactions with the audience.
2. **Rehearsal Simulations:** Incorporate rehearsal simulations that mimic the tour environment, including lighting, sound checks, and performance logistics.
3. **Adaptability:** Practice adapting to new situations, such as unexpected equipment failures or changes in setlists.

**Personalized Recommendations:**

Considering Matthew's background in music and guitar, I recommend:

* Practicing "Hotel California" by the Eagles for its iconic riffs and chord progression
* Learning a simple but effective fingerpicking pattern to enhance his playing style
* Developing a stronger sense of timing and dynamics to deliver more nuanced performances

By focusing on these areas, Matthew will be well-prepared for touring readiness, blending his musical expertise with the demands of live performance.
