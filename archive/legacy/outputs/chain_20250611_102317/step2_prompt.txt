2. **Rent vs. Ownership:** Considering the potential monthly rent range of $1,200-$1,500, it may be more cost-effective to own a new home, especially if they plan to stay for an extended period.
3. **New Home Budget:** With a combined income of $145,000 and a monthly take-home income of approximately $6,200, the couple has a comfortable budget to allocate towards a new home.

**Personal Preferences:**

1. **Emotional Attachment:** Matthew's girlfriend is emotionally attached to their current apartment, which may make it difficult for her to leave.
2. **Flexibility:** Considering a temporary move to Matthew's house while house hunting could be a viable option, allowing them to maintain flexibility and avoid the stress of moving twice.

**Long-term Goals:**

1. **Thought Leadership:** Matthew's goal of becoming a LinkedIn thought leader by the end of 2025 is ambitious but achievable with careful planning.
2. **Family Considerations:** The couple's daughter is starting 2nd grade, and her changing school schedule may impact their living situation.

Based on the analysis, here are some key considerations for Matthew and his girlfriend:

1. **Weigh the pros and cons of staying in the current apartment vs. moving to a new home:** Consider factors such as cost, flexibility, and emotional attachment.
2. **Assess the feasibility of owning a new home:** Evaluate the potential monthly rent range, new home budget, and long-term goals.
3. **Explore temporary housing options:** Temporary moves to Matthew's house while house hunting could be a viable solution, allowing them to maintain flexibility and avoid the stress of moving twice.

**Recommendation:**

Based on the comprehensive analysis, I recommend that Matthew and his girlfriend consider the following:

1. **Temporary move to Matthew's house:** Allow them to maintain flexibility and avoid the stress of moving twice while they explore new home options.
