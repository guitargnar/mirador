**Decision:**
Implement a comprehensive Python performance optimization framework for AI workloads to achieve significant improvements in execution time and memory usage.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Option 1**: Focus on optimizing individual components (e.g., profiling, vectorization, memory management) using existing tools and libraries.
2. **Option 2**: Develop a custom implementation of the Mirador System's performance optimization framework using Python and AI-specific libraries.
3. **Option 3**: Integrate popular open-source frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch with optimized performance features.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
**Option 1**

- Leverage existing tools and libraries to minimize development time and effort
- Focus on optimizing individual components for better overall performance
- Ensure compatibility with existing codebase and AI workloads

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Implement profiling using cProfile, line_profiler, and memory_profiler (next week)
□ Vectorize code using NumPy, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (next 2 weeks)
□ Optimize memory management using generators, optimized data structures, and caching (next month)

**WATCH FOR:**
⚠️ Inefficient use of CPU cores due to poor parallelization
⚠️ Memory leaks caused by inadequate memory management
