**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

The cost of an executive MBA program can vary widely depending on factors such as location, institution, duration, and format. However, here are some approximate costs for popular executive MBA programs:

* Full-time Executive MBA:
	+ Tuition: $100,000 - $200,000
	+ Living expenses (2-3 years): $50,000 - $100,000
	+ Total cost: $150,000 - $300,000
* Part-time Executive MBA:
	+ Tuition: $80,000 - $180,000
	+ Living expenses (4-6 years): $30,000 - $60,000
	+ Total cost: $110,000 - $240,000

Assuming a 2-year part-time program with a total cost of $160,000, here's a rough estimate of the return on investment:

* Assuming an average salary increase of 20% after completing the program (based on national averages), your new salary would be: $75,000 x 1.20 = $90,000
* With the increased salary, you can expect to save approximately $10,000 - $15,000 per year in living expenses due to your higher earning potential.
* Over the course of the program (2 years), this translates to a savings of: $20,000 - $30,000
