**Additional Recommendations:**

* Consider automating Matthew's savings by setting up automatic transfers from his checking account to his savings accounts.
* Encourage Matthew to take advantage of employer-matched retirement accounts, such as a 401(k) plan, if available.
* Suggest that Matthew review and adjust his budget regularly (e.g., every 3-6 months) to ensure he's on track to meet his financial goals.

**Kentucky-Specific Tax Considerations:**

* As a resident of Kentucky, Matthew will need to pay state income tax on his earnings. Review the state's tax brackets and rates to understand how this may impact his take-home pay.
* Research any potential tax credits or deductions available to Kentuckians that could help reduce Matthew's tax liability.

**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations:**

* Encourage Matthew to explore ways to save money on everyday expenses, such as cooking at home, packing lunches, and reducing entertainment costs.
