**DECISION:** Implement a hybrid approach that combines automated decision-making with human oversight to ensure accuracy and relevance of EAE model outputs.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Option 1**: Develop a comprehensive training program for human reviewers and validators, including regular workshops and feedback sessions.
2. **Option 2**: Integrate human oversight into the decision-making process through a web-based platform that allows for real-time review and validation.
3. **Option 3**: Establish a cross-functional task force to oversee the implementation of the hybrid approach, ensuring alignment with business objectives and stakeholder needs.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Option 1

* Conduct thorough training and education programs for human reviewers and validators to ensure accuracy and fairness in decision-making.
* Provide regular feedback and coaching to support continuous improvement.
* Monitor training effectiveness through regular assessments and evaluations.

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Develop a comprehensive training program for human reviewers and validators (Weeks 1-4).
□ Conduct thorough testing and validation of the hybrid approach (Weeks 5-8).
□ Establish a cross-functional task force to oversee implementation (Ongoing).

**WATCH FOR:**

⚠️ **Biases in Human Oversight**: Ensure that human reviewers and validators are properly trained and educated to minimize biases in decision-making.
⚠️ **Resource Constraints**: Monitor resource utilization and adjust training programs or staffing levels as needed to ensure effective implementation of the hybrid approach.
