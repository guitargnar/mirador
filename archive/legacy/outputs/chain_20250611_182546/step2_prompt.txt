Based on your specified income of $75,000, I'll provide a comprehensive plan to help you build a successful six-figure freelance consulting business while maintaining full-time employment.

**Income Confirmation:**
Based on your specified income of $75,000, I'll assume this is your annual salary from your full-time job. To calculate your monthly take-home pay, we can use the following assumptions:

* 25% tax bracket
* 4% for health insurance and other benefits

Monthly take-home pay: $75,000 x 0.75 (1 - 0.25) = $56,250 per month

**Budget Framework:**
To build a six-figure freelance consulting business, you'll need to allocate your time, energy, and resources effectively. Here's a suggested budget framework:

* Time commitment: 10% of your monthly take-home pay (=$5,625)
* Business expenses:
	+ Marketing and advertising: $1,000 per month
	+ Software and tools: $500 per month
	+ Insurance and benefits: $500 per month
	+ Miscellaneous (office supplies, travel, etc.): $500 per month
* Savings for taxes and benefits: 10% of your monthly take-home pay (=$5,625)
