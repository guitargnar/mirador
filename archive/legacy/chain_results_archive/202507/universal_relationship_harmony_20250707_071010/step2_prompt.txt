Navigating this complex situation requires careful consideration of multiple factors, including emotional intelligence, communication, and boundary-setting. Here are some suggestions to help you build a relationship with Katie while ensuring Sage's security and maintaining your pattern recognition skills:

**Communicate with Sage:**

1. **Honesty is key**: Explain to Sage that you're dating someone new (Katie) and involve him in the conversation. Be open about your feelings, but also reassure him that his well-being is a top priority.
2. **Reassure Sage of boundaries**: Let Sage know that your relationship with Katie won't change your role as his primary caregiver. Establish clear boundaries to maintain consistency and stability.
3. **Involve Katie in Sage's life**: Encourage Katie to spend time with Sage, participate in activities he enjoys, and establish a positive relationship with him.

**Building trust with Katie:**

1. **Gradual introduction**: Introduce Katie to Sage gradually, allowing him to become comfortable with her presence.
2. **Establish a co-parenting routine**: Create a routine where both you and Katie are involved in Sage's daily life, ensuring he feels secure and loved.
3. **Communicate with Katie about boundaries**: Discuss your boundaries, expectations, and concerns with Katie. This will help prevent misunderstandings and ensure you're both on the same page.
4. **Be transparent about your past**: Share your past experiences, including your relationship with Angela and your role as a single father. This can help Katie understand your perspective and build trust.

**Maintaining pattern recognition:**

1. **Set boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries between your work (AI innovation) and personal life. This will prevent you from becoming too invested in work-related issues that might affect your relationship with Katie or Sage.
2. **Prioritize self-care**: Make time for self-care and stress management to maintain your emotional well-being. This will help you stay focused on building a healthy relationship with Katie.
3. **Reflect on your triggers**: Identify potential triggers that might lead to pattern recognition (e.g., feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or insecure). Develop strategies to manage these triggers, such as meditation, exercise, or talking to a therapist.
4. **Use your pattern recognition for positive purposes**: Apply your pattern recognition skills to improve your relationship with Katie and Sage, rather than letting them control or sabotage your interactions.

**Trust-building exercises:**

1. **Joint planning**: Plan activities or outings with Katie that involve Sage. This can help you build trust and demonstrate your commitment to creating a harmonious household.
