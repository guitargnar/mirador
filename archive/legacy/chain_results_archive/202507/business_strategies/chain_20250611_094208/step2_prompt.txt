**Building Mirador: The Power of Automation**

As a Humana Risk Management Professional II, I've always been driven by a passion for efficiency and innovation. Recently, I spent over 100 hours building my own automation framework, Mirador AI. At first glance, it might seem like a monumental task - after all, automating tasks that take only 10 hours per year can't be that significant, right?

But here's the thing: those 10 hours add up. And when you're talking about repetitive, mundane tasks that suck away valuable time and energy from more strategic pursuits... well, let's just say it's a lot.

With Mirador, I've been able to automate my weekly vulnerability report generation, saving me (and my team) countless hours of tedious data entry and analysis. But the real game-changer is the insights we're gaining from this automation. By automating tasks that were previously manual, we're freeing up resources for more high-impact work.

So why did I invest so much time into building Mirador? It's not about the time itself - it's about the impact. By automating tasks that take away from our core focus, we can:

* Increase productivity and efficiency
* Gain insights and data that inform better decision-making
* Drive innovation and growth

As I continue to build out Mirador, I'm excited to see how this technology will empower my team and drive real results in the world of Medicare compliance. Stay tuned for more updates on our journey!
