**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations:**

Louisville has a relatively low cost of living compared to other major cities in the United States. However, it's essential to consider the following expenses:

As a resident of Kentucky, Matthew will be subject to the state income tax rate of 5%. This means that for every dollar earned, he'll pay 5 cents in state taxes. To illustrate this, let's assume Matthew earns $175,000 per year and pays 5% in state taxes:

* State taxes: $8,750 (5% of $175,000)

* The Kentucky Arts Council: A state agency that provides funding for arts projects, including music initiatives.
* Local music schools and colleges: Institutions like the University of Louisville's School of Music and the Louisville Music Academy offer courses, workshops, and degree programs in music and related fields.
