**DECISION:** Invest $200,000 in developing an AI/ML-powered chatbot to improve customer service efficiency for a local startup.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Option 1**: Develop the chatbot using a cloud-based platform with pre-built templates and integrations, reducing development time and costs.
2. **Option 2**: Create a custom-built chatbot solution using in-house resources, allowing for more control over the design and functionality but increasing development time and costs.
3. **Option 3**: Leverage a third-party AI/ML service provider to develop the chatbot, sharing revenue generated by the chatbot with the provider.
