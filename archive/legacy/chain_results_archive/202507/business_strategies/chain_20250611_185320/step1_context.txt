	* Term life insurance (20-year coverage): 0.5% - 1% of annual income ($375 - $750)
	* Whole life insurance (optional): 2% - 3% of annual income ($1,250 - $1,875)
2. Disability Insurance:
	* Short-term disability insurance (6-12 months coverage): 1% - 2% of annual income ($750 - $1,500)

**Louisville-Specific Considerations:**

1. Kentucky state income tax: With a flat rate of 5%, you may want to consider increasing your life insurance coverage to account for potential taxes on death benefits.
2. Jefferson County property tax rates: As a homeowner, you'll need to factor in property taxes when calculating your overall expenses.

**Implementation Steps with Local Resources:**

1. Life Insurance:
	* Research and compare term life insurance options from local carriers (e.g., Humana, Blue Cross Blue Shield).
	* Consider whole life insurance if you want a permanent policy or cash value accumulation.
2. Disability Insurance:
	* Contact local disability insurance providers (e.g., Prudential, MetLife) to discuss short-term and long-term coverage options.
3. Umbrella Insurance:
	* Shop around for liability umbrella insurance policies from reputable carriers (e.g., State Farm, Allstate).
4. Specialty Coverage:
	* If self-employed, research business liability insurance options with local carriers or brokers.

**Professional Consultation Recommendations:**

1. Life Insurance: Consult with a licensed insurance agent to determine the best term life insurance policy for your needs.
2. Disability Insurance: Discuss short-term and long-term disability insurance options with a licensed broker or agent.
3. Umbrella Insurance: Work with an independent insurance agent to find the most suitable liability umbrella insurance policy.
