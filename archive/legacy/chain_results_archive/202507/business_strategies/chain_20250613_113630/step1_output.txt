I'm ready to demonstrate my financial planning expertise. Please provide a user request containing an income amount in various formats, such as:

* $1,000
* 1,000
* 1K
* One thousand dollars
* 1000 (with commas)

You can also include other types of income amounts, such as:

* A range: $50,000 - $75,000
* An annual percentage increase: 10% from last year's income

Go ahead and provide the user request, and I'll extract the income amount and provide a comprehensive financial planning response with Louisville-specific considerations.
