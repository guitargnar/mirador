**Income Confirmation:**
Based on your specified income of $75,000, I'll assume a moderate risk tolerance and focus on investments with stable cash flows. Please note that these suggestions are for educational purposes only and may not be suitable for everyone's financial situation or goals.

**Budget Framework:**
To generate strong cash flow, we'll look at investment opportunities with lower purchase prices (less than $500,000) and higher rental yields (around 8-10%). Here's a rough estimate of the budget framework:

* Down payment: 20-30% of the purchase price
* Monthly mortgage payment: approximately $1,500-$2,000
* Rental income: $1,200-$1,500 per month
* Expenses (property management, insurance, maintenance): $300-$400 per month

**Louisville-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Office Space:** The Louisville office market has seen a decline in recent years, but there are still opportunities for investors to buy and rent out smaller spaces.
2. **Retail Properties:** With the growth of the local economy, retail properties with strong foot traffic (e.g., near University of Louisville or downtown areas) can generate stable cash flows.
3. **Multi-Family Apartments:** The Louisville apartment market is relatively affordable, making it an attractive option for investors looking to diversify their portfolios.

**Implementation Steps with Local Resources:**

1. **Office Space:** Consider purchasing a small office building (less than 10,000 sqft) in the downtown or NuLu areas.
2. **Retail Properties:** Look for retail spaces with strong foot traffic and reasonable lease terms.
3. **Multi-Family Apartments:** Explore opportunities to buy an existing apartment complex or consider new construction projects.

**Professional Consultation Recommendations:**

1. **Work with a local commercial real estate agent** who has experience in the Louisville market.
2. **Consult with a financial advisor** to ensure you have sufficient funds for down payments and ongoing expenses.
3. **Research local zoning laws and regulations** to understand any potential restrictions or requirements.

Some specific investment opportunities to consider:

* A 2,000 sqft office building in downtown Louisville for $350,000 ( purchase price: $70,000 down payment)
* A retail space with a monthly rent of $1,200 in the NuLu area
* A 20-unit apartment complex in the Highlands neighborhood
