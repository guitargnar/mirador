**DECISION:** Enhance Prompt Engineering Skills to Unlock Career Advancement Opportunities in Healthcare Technology.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Option 1**: Invest $0 - Utilize existing time and resources, but risk falling behind industry developments and struggling to find suitable training programs.
2. **Option 2**: Allocate $5,000 - $10,000 for online courses, workshops, or conferences to develop advanced prompt engineering skills, potentially leading to a higher return on investment.
3. **Option 3**: Pursue a part-time Master's degree in Healthcare Technology with a focus on AI and NLP, which may require an additional $20,000 - $30,000 investment, but could lead to significant career advancement opportunities.

**RECOMMENDATION:** **Option 2**

- Develop advanced skills in prompt engineering, increasing the likelihood of securing high-paying job opportunities.
- Stay up-to-date with industry developments and best practices, reducing the risk of falling behind.
- Potential for higher return on investment compared to investing $0 or pursuing a full-time degree.

**NEXT STEPS:**
