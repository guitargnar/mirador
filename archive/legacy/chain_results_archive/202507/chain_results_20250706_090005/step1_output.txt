Sweep Pick Exercises:

1. **Basic Sweep**: Focus on the wrist motion, keeping the forearm still. Start with a slow tempo (120 BPM) and increase as you become more comfortable.
	* Tab: e|---0---2---3---2---0---|
	* Fingering: 3rd finger on 5th fret of D string, 1st finger on 7th fret of G string
	* Repeat with the other hand, starting from the low E string
2. **Alternating Sweep**: Alternate picking between the sweep and regular picking to develop coordination.
	* Tab: e|---0---2---3---2---0---|
	* Fingering: Same as above, but alternate hands on each note
3. **Sweep Picking Patterns**: Practice simple patterns using sweep picking (e.g., 4-note pattern, 8-note pattern)

Cool-down (10 minutes):

* Slowly decrease the tempo to focus on accuracy and control

	* Tab: e|---5---7---5---7---5---|
	* Fingering: Same as above

Cool-down (5 minutes):

* Review your notes and make connections between theory and practice

**Day 4: Sweep Picking Variations**

Objective: Expand your sweep picking technique to include variations and nuances

Warm-up (10 minutes):

* Review basic sweep picking exercises
* Focus on finger independence and wrist motion

Sweep Pick Variations:

1. **Legato Sweep**: Focus on smooth, connected playing using legato techniques.
	* Tab: e|---0---2---3---2---0---|
	* Fingering: Same as above, but with a focus on connecting notes
2. **Tremolo Picking**: Introduce tremolo picking to add texture and variety to your sweep picking.
	* Tab: e|---0---1---2---3---0---|
	* Fingering: Same as above, but using alternating picking

Cool-down (10 minutes):

* Review your progress and make adjustments as needed

**Day 5: Rhythm Development**

Objective: Refine your rhythm playing and develop a strong sense of timing

Warm-up (10 minutes):

* Review basic arpeggios in A minor
* Focus on playing with a strong, consistent rhythm

Rhythm Exercises:

1. **Polyrhythms**: Introduce polyrhythmic patterns to challenge your timing and coordination.
	* Tab: e|---0---2---3---2---0---|
	* Fingering: Same as above
2. **Time Signatures**: Practice playing in different time signatures (e.g., 6/8, 12/8) to develop your sense of rhythm and meter.

Cool-down (10 minutes):

* Review your progress and make adjustments as needed

**Day 6: Music Analysis**

Objective: Analyze and understand the scales, modes, and techniques used in existing music

Warm-up (5 minutes):

* Review basic arpeggios in A minor
* Focus on finger placement and hand position

Music Analysis Exercises:

**Day 7: Practice Routine Integration**

Objective: Integrate sweep picking, rhythm development, and theory into a cohesive practice routine

Warm-up (10 minutes):

* Review basic arpeggios in A minor
* Focus on finger placement and hand position

Practice Routine:

1. **Sweep Picking**: Practice sweep picking exercises from Days 1-4, focusing on accuracy and control.
2. **Rhythm Development**: Play along with a metronome or backing track to develop your timing and rhythm.
3. **Theory Translation**: Review scales, modes, and chord progressions used in metal music.

Cool-down (10 minutes):
