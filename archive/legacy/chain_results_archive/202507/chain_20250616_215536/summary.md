## Step 1: master_guitar_instructor (execution time: 00:00)



## Step 2: guitar_tone_architect (execution time: 00:25)

As the Guitar Tone Architect for Mirador, I'd like to expand on our previous discussion and provide more tailored guidance for achieving professional guitar tones.

**Metal Tones (Modern and Classic)**

For metal tones, we'll focus on aggressive, high-gain sounds that cut through any mix. Here's a suggested setup:

* Amp: Use a high-gain amp with a tight low-end response. Some options include:
	+ Mesa/Boogie Rectifier
	+ Marshall JCM800
	+ ENGL E645
* Gain Structure:
	+ Start with a moderate gain setting (around 6-7) and adjust as needed for your playing style.
	+ Use the Presence control to boost high-end frequencies for a more aggressive tone.
* EQ:
	+ Cut around 200 Hz to reduce muddiness and emphasize midrange clarity.
	+ Boost around 500 Hz to add definition and punch.
	+ Cut around 10 kHz to prevent harshness and maintain a tight low-end response.
* Compression:
	+ Use a compressor like the MXR Dyna Comp or the Keeley Electronics Compressor to control dynamics and even out the tone.
	+ Set the threshold around -20 dB, ratio at 4:1, and attack/release times around 10-30 ms.

**Rock (Indie to Hard Rock)**

For rock tones, we'll aim for a balanced sound that's both punchy and articulate. Here's a suggested setup:

* Amp: Use an amp with a versatile tone range, such as:
	+ Fender Twin Reverb
	+ Vox AC30
	+ Marshall JCM800
* Gain Structure:
	+ Start with a moderate gain setting (around 5-6) and adjust as needed for your playing style.
	+ Use the Bass control to boost low-end frequencies for added weight and depth.
* EQ:
	+ Cut around 150 Hz to reduce muddiness and emphasize midrange clarity.
	+ Boost around 250 Hz to add definition and punch.
	+ Cut around 5 kHz to prevent harshness and maintain a balanced tone.
* Compression:
	+ Use a compressor like the MXR Dyna Comp or the Keeley Electronics Compressor to control dynamics and even out the tone.
	+ Set the threshold around -20 dB, ratio at 4:1, and attack/release times around 10-30 ms.

**Clean Tones for Session Work**

For clean tones, we'll focus on a bright, articulate sound that cuts through any mix. Here's a suggested setup:

* Amp: Use an amp with a clear, transparent tone, such as:
	+ Fender Deluxe Reverb
	+ Vox AC30
	+ Orange Crush 20
* Gain Structure:
	+ Start with a low gain setting (around 2-3) and adjust as needed for your playing style.
	+ Use the Presence control to boost high-end frequencies for added clarity.
* EQ:
	+ Boost around 5 kHz to add brightness and definition.
	+ Cut around 200 Hz to reduce muddiness and maintain a clear tone.
* Compression:
	+ Avoid using compression on clean tones, as it can muddy the sound. Instead, focus on maintaining a consistent volume level.

**Effects Pedal Combinations**

For metal and rock tones, here are some suggested effects pedal combinations:

* Metal:
	+ Distortion: Boss DS-1 or Pro Co RAT
	+ Overdrive: Tube Screamer or Fulltone OCD
	+ Reverb: Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail or Strymon Blue Sky
	+ Delay: TC Electronic Flashback or Eventide H9
* Rock:
	+ Distortion: MXR Distortion+ or Boss DS-1
	+ Overdrive: Tube Screamer or Fulltone OCD
	+ Reverb: Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail or Strymon Blue Sky
	+ Delay: TC Electronic Flashback or Eventide H9

**Amp Simulation Optimization**

To optimize amp simulation settings, follow these guidelines:

* Use a high-quality amp simulator like Amplitube or Guitar Rig.
* Choose an amp model that matches your playing style and tone preferences.
* Adjust the gain structure, EQ, and compression settings to match your desired tone.
* Experiment with different cab simulations and mic placements to find the optimal sound.

**Signal Chain Optimization**

To optimize signal chains, follow these guidelines:

* Start with a clean signal from your guitar.
* Add effects pedals in a logical order (e.g., overdrive, distortion, reverb).
* Use high-quality cables and connectors to minimize signal degradation.
* Experiment with different signal chain configurations to find the optimal sound.

**Budget-Conscious Gear Recommendations**

For budget-conscious gear recommendations, consider the following:

* Amps: Fender Twin Reverb or Vox AC30 (around $1,000-$2,000)
* Effects pedals: MXR Distortion+ or Tube Screamer (around $100-$300 each)
* Cables and connectors: Mogami or Bare Wire cables (around $20-$50)

By following these guidelines and experimenting with different settings and configurations, you'll be well on your way to achieving professional guitar tones that cut through any mix.

## Step 3: performance_anxiety_coach (execution time: 00:22)

As the Performance Anxiety Coach for Mirador, I'd like to help you tackle performance anxiety and build stage confidence. Here are some specific, actionable techniques for managing performance anxiety and building stage charisma:

**Anxiety Management Techniques:**

1. **Breathing Exercises:** Practice deep breathing exercises before each show to calm your nerves. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.
2. **Positive Self-Talk:** Develop a positive self-talk framework to boost your confidence. Repeat phrases like "I've got this," "I'm prepared," or "I can handle anything."
3. **Visualization Exercises:** Close your eyes and visualize yourself performing flawlessly. Imagine the audience applauding, your bandmates supporting you, and yourself feeling confident and in control.
4. **Physical Release:** Engage in physical activities like yoga, stretching, or jogging to release tension before a show.

**Confidence Building Exercises:**

1. **Mirror Work:** Practice your performance in front of a mirror. Observe your body language, facial expressions, and stage presence. Make adjustments as needed.
2. **Record Yourself:** Record yourself performing and watch the footage. Analyze your strengths and weaknesses, and make improvements for future shows.
3. **Rehearsal with a Friend:** Rehearse with a friend or family member who can provide constructive feedback and support.
4. **Positive Affirmations:** Write down positive affirmations about yourself and your performance. Read them daily to boost your confidence.

**Mental Rehearsal Strategies:**

1. **Rehearse in Different Environments:** Practice your performance in different environments, such as a rehearsal space or outdoor location, to simulate the actual show experience.
2. **Visualize Different Scenarios:** Imagine different scenarios that might arise during the show, such as technical issues or an audience member asking a question. Prepare responses and solutions in advance.
3. **Focus on Your Strengths:** Concentrate on your strengths and abilities, rather than dwelling on areas for improvement.
4. **Develop a Pre-Show Routine:** Establish a consistent pre-show routine to help you feel more grounded and focused.

**Recovery from Performance Mistakes:**

1. **Learn from Mistakes:** Analyze what went wrong during the show and use it as an opportunity to learn and improve.
2. **Practice Forgiveness:** Treat yourself with kindness and compassion if you make a mistake. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, even experienced performers.
3. **Focus on the Next Show:** Instead of dwelling on past mistakes, focus on preparing for the next show and improving your performance.
4. **Seek Support:** Talk to friends, family, or colleagues about any concerns or feelings of anxiety. They can offer valuable support and guidance.

**Building Stage Charisma:**

1. **Connect with Your Audience:** Engage with your audience by making eye contact, telling stories, and involving them in the performance.
2. **Develop a Unique Personality:** Cultivate a unique personality that shines through in your performances. This will help you stand out and connect with your audience on a deeper level.
3. **Practice Vulnerability:** Share personal anecdotes or emotions during your performance to create a sense of vulnerability and connection with your audience.
4. **Embody the Music:** Let the music guide your movements, expressions, and energy. This will help you connect with your audience and convey the emotional depth of the music.

By incorporating these techniques into your daily routine, you'll be better equipped to manage performance anxiety and build stage confidence. Remember that building stage charisma is a process, and it takes time, patience, and practice to develop.
