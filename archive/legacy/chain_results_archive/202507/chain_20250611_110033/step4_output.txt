**DECISION:** Adopt a user-centered design approach to create a more intuitive and personalized experience for users, with a focus on conducting user research and creating personas to inform the redesign of specialist models and chains.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **User-Centered Design**: Adopt a user-centered design approach to create a more intuitive and personalized experience for users.
2. **Model-agnostic Optimization**: Explore opportunities for model-agnostic optimization techniques, such as reinforcement learning or meta-learning, to improve the overall performance of specialist models and chains.
3. **Systemic Optimization**: Focus on optimizing the entire system, rather than individual components, to identify opportunities for improvement and reduce complexity.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Adopt a user-centered design approach
- By conducting user research and creating personas, we can gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and needs, leading to a more effective and personalized experience.
- This approach will also inform the redesign of specialist models and chains, ensuring that they are optimized for user performance.
- Additionally, this approach aligns with our goal of improving user satisfaction and experience.

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Conduct user research and create personas (Q2, Q3)
□ Refine prompt structures to improve model performance and user experience (Q4, Q1)
□ Develop a systemic optimization framework to analyze and improve the overall performance of the Mirador system (Q1, Q2)

**WATCH FOR:**
⚠️ Insufficient understanding of user behavior and needs
⚠️ Limited resources or budget for user research and design implementation
