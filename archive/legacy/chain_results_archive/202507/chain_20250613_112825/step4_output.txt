**DECISION:** Carefully selecting a combination of multiple evaluation metrics for AI model performance can provide a more comprehensive understanding of model accuracy while minimizing the challenges associated with ensemble methods.

**OPTIONS:**

1.  **Metric Selection**: Selecting metrics that complement each other, such as precision and recall, to address different aspects of model performance.
2.  **Ensemble Method Optimization**: Optimizing the ensemble method to minimize overfitting and ensure individual metrics are not overly optimized for a single task.
3.  **Regular Evaluation and Monitoring**: Regularly evaluating and monitoring the ensemble method's performance to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Implementing a combination of metric selection, ensemble method optimization, and regular evaluation and monitoring.

-   **Improved Model Accuracy**: By selecting metrics that complement each other, we can improve overall model accuracy.
-   **Reduced Overfitting**: Optimizing the ensemble method reduces overfitting and ensures individual metrics are not overly optimized for a single task.
-   **Increased Confidence in Results**: Regular evaluation and monitoring ensure continued accuracy and effectiveness.

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Selecting metrics that complement each other (this week)
□ Optimizing the ensemble method to minimize overfitting (next 2 weeks)
□ Implementing regular evaluation and monitoring of the ensemble method's performance (this month)

**WATCH FOR:**

⚠️ Overfitting if individual metrics are overly optimized for a single task
⚠️ Reduced diversity in the evaluation process if multiple metrics are too similar
