**Decision:** Implement advanced feature engineering techniques in Mirador model optimization to improve accuracy and reliability.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Transfer Learning**: Leverage pre-trained models and fine-tune them on the specific Mirador dataset to adapt to unique characteristics.
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple models and techniques to create a more robust and accurate prediction system.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns and outliers in the data.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Ensemble Methods
- Improves model generalization and robustness
- Enhances accuracy by combining multiple models' strengths
- Facilitates hyperparameter tuning and model selection

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Develop a pipeline for ensemble methods implementation (Weeks 1-4)
□ Train and evaluate individual models using transfer learning and anomaly detection techniques (Weeks 5-8)
□ Integrate the ensemble models with Mirador's existing architecture (Weeks 9-12)

**WATCH FOR:**
⚠️ Overfitting risks due to increased model complexity
⚠️ Data quality issues that may impact ensemble performance
