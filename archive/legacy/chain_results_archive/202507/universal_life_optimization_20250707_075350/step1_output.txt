As a father, you're walking a delicate balance between providing stability and modeling healthy relationships for Sage. Your personal experiences with insecurity can inform your approach, but it's essential to separate your past from your present and future. Here are some suggestions to help you create a stable yet nurturing environment:

1. **Communicate openly and honestly**: Share your own struggles with insecurity and how you've worked through them. This will help Sage understand that everyone experiences vulnerabilities and that seeking help is a sign of strength. Be transparent about your own fears, doubts, and mistakes.
2. **Model emotional regulation**: Show Sage how to manage emotions, express feelings, and cope with challenges. Demonstrate healthy emotional regulation by staying calm in stressful situations, taking time to reflect, and practicing self-care.
3. **Foster a growth mindset**: Encourage Sage to view failures and setbacks as opportunities for growth and learning. Emphasize that mistakes are an essential part of the learning process and that you're there to support him.
4. **Prioritize quality time**: Spend dedicated time with Sage, engaging in activities he enjoys. This will help him feel seen, heard, and valued. Make sure to also spend time with Katie, demonstrating a strong and healthy relationship model.
5. **Establish clear boundaries and routines**: Provide a sense of security and predictability by establishing routines, setting clear boundaries, and being consistent in your behavior. This will help Sage feel more grounded and secure.
6. **Encourage independence**: Gradually give Sage more autonomy, allowing him to make decisions and take responsibility for his actions. This will help him develop problem-solving skills, confidence, and self-reliance.
7. **Practice active listening**: When interacting with Sage, actively listen to what he says, and show that you're engaged in the conversation. This will help him feel heard, validated, and understood.
8. **Show physical affection**: Physical touch is essential for emotional development. Show Sage love, affection, and comfort through hugs, kisses, and cuddles.
9. **Create a sense of teamwork**: Engage Sage in activities that require collaboration and teamwork. This will help him develop social skills, empathy, and a sense of belonging.
10. **Seek support when needed**: Don't be afraid to ask for help from Katie, family, friends, or a therapist if you're struggling to balance your own emotions or provide the best possible environment for Sage.

Day-to-day examples:

* Establish a daily routine that includes dedicated time with Sage, such as:
	+ Breakfast together
	+ Outdoor playtime or a fun activity
	+ Reading or working on a project together
	+ Dinner and evening conversation
* Model healthy communication by actively listening to Sage and responding thoughtfully.
* Engage in activities with Katie that showcase your relationship, such as:
	+ Cooking together
	+ Going on dates
	+ Practicing joint hobbies
* Prioritize self-care and take time for yourself to recharge. This will help you be more present and patient with Sage.
* When discussing challenging topics or emotions with Sage, use "I" statements instead of "you" statements, which can come across as accusatory.

Remember, being a good role model is an ongoing process that requires effort, patience, and self-awareness. By following these suggestions and staying true to your values, you'll help create a stable and nurturing environment for Sage to grow and thrive.
