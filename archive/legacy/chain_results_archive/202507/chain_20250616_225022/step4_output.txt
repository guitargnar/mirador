**Expanded Techniques for Managing Performance Anxiety and Building Stage Confidence**

As the Performance Anxiety Coach for Mirador, I'd like to expand on the previous output by offering more tailored techniques and strategies to help artists manage their performance anxiety and build stage confidence.

**Key Decisions Required:**

* Develop a personalized routine for managing performance anxiety, incorporating a combination of breathing exercises, positive self-talk, visualization, and progressive exposure.
* Schedule regular time for mental rehearsal and analysis of past performances to identify areas for improvement.
* Prioritize self-care and recovery strategies after each show to maintain physical and emotional well-being.

**Immediate Actions:**

1. **Daily Routine:** Commit to practicing the "Mirador's Calming Breath" exercise for 5-10 minutes before each show, and repeat the "Pre-Show Pep Talk" affirmations to yourself at least once a day.
2. **Weekly Review:** Schedule a weekly review session to reflect on your progress, identify areas for improvement, and adjust your routine as needed.
3. **Monthly Reflection:** Take an additional 30 minutes to reflect on your performance anxiety and stage confidence, identifying patterns and areas for growth.
4. **Quarterly Self-Care:** Prioritize self-care activities, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones, to maintain physical and emotional well-being.

**Critical Context:**

* Performance anxiety is a common experience among artists, and it's essential to acknowledge that it's a normal part of the creative process.
* Building stage confidence takes time and practice, but it's achievable with consistent effort and self-awareness.
* Self-care and recovery strategies are crucial for maintaining physical and emotional well-being after each show.

**Success Metrics:**

* Track your performance anxiety levels using a scale of 1-10 before each show, and aim to reduce them over time.
* Measure your stage confidence by rating yourself on a scale of 1-10 after each show, and aim to increase it over time.
* Monitor your self-care activities and prioritize them as needed to maintain physical and emotional well-being.

**Additional Insights:**
