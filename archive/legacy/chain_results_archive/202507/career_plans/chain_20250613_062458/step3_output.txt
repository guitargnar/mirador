**DECISION:**
To optimize AI-powered tools in healthcare by developing a comprehensive approach to prompt engineering that incorporates clear and concise language, contextualization, specificity, relevance, and feedback.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **Option 1**: Develop a centralized database of patient-specific information, medical history, and genetic data to inform prompts.
2. **Option 2**: Establish a multidisciplinary team to develop and refine prompts, incorporating input from healthcare professionals, clinicians, and AI developers.
3. **Option 3**: Implement a continuous learning loop, where feedback is incorporated into the prompt engineering process on an ongoing basis.

**RECOMMENDATION:**
**Option 1**: Develop a centralized database of patient-specific information, medical history, and genetic data to inform prompts.
- Enhances accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses
- Reduces misdiagnosis or misinterpretation
- Improves patient outcomes

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Develop centralized database (this week)
□ Establish multidisciplinary team (next 2 weeks)
□ Implement continuous learning loop (this month)

**WATCH FOR:**
⚠️ Insufficient data quality in centralized database
⚠️ Inadequate feedback mechanisms for continuous learning loop
