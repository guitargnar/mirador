OPTIONS:
1. **Implement a blockchain-based data registry**: Establish a decentralized database to store and manage patient data, ensuring transparency and control.
2. **Develop an AI-driven analytics platform**: Create a centralized hub for healthcare providers to access standardized insights from patient data, streamlining decision-making.
3. **Establish a genomics data standardization initiative**: Collaborate with industry leaders to create a common language for genomic data sharing, facilitating research and innovation.

RECOMMENDATION: Implement a blockchain-based data registry
- Ensures patient data security and control
- Facilitates seamless data exchange between healthcare providers
- Reduces risk of data breaches and cyber attacks

NEXT STEPS:
□ Develop a detailed business case for the data registry project (this month)
□ Establish partnerships with key industry stakeholders to drive adoption (next 2 months)
□ Conduct thorough testing and validation of the blockchain-based data registry (this quarter)

WATCH FOR:
⚠️ Inadequate data governance leading to security breaches
⚠️ Insufficient standardization hindering data sharing and collaboration
