**Kentucky State Tax Implications:**

As a resident of Kentucky, Matthew is subject to the state income tax rate of 5%. This means that his take-home pay will be reduced by 5% due to state taxes.

Gross Income: $75,000
Federal Income Tax (approx.): $12,000
Kentucky State Income Tax (5%): $3,750
Total Taxes: $15,750
Take-Home Pay: $59,250

**Louisville-Specific Cost of Living Considerations:**

To ensure Matthew's budget is realistic and takes into account the local cost of living, I've considered the following expenses:

* Average 1BR rent in Louisville: $1,000-1,300 (Matthew's housing expense is within this range)
* Average 2BR rent in Louisville: $1,200-1,600 (Matthew's housing expense is slightly above this range, but still manageable)
* Transportation costs (car payment, insurance, gas): $5,000
* Food expenses (groceries, dining out): $3,500

**Actionable Recommendations:**

To further optimize Matthew's budget and achieve his financial goals, I recommend the following:

1. **Emergency Fund:** Continue to save 10% of income ($7,500) for the next 12-18 months.
2. **Retirement Savings:** Contribute at least 5% of income ($3,750) towards retirement savings.
3. **Debt Repayment:** Focus on paying off high-interest loans or credit cards as quickly as possible, aiming to eliminate them within the next 12-18 months.
4. **Business and Music Expenses:** Review Matthew's business expenses and adjust as needed to ensure he's staying within his allocated budget of $11,250.
5. **Touring Income:** Aim to earn at least $20,000 per tour, with a goal of 4-6 tours per year.
6. **Music Sales and Licensing:** Target $5,000 in music sales and licensing income per year.
7. **Merchandise and Sponsorships:** Estimate $2,000 in merchandise sales and sponsorship revenue per year.

**Local Financial Resources and Opportunities:**

Louisville offers a range of financial resources and opportunities for Matthew to explore:

1. **Kentucky Small Business Development Center (KSBC):** Provides free business consulting and low-cost training programs.
2. **Louisville Metro Government's Economic Development Office:** Offers resources and support for local businesses, including access to funding and networking opportunities.
3. **The Louisville Foundation:** A community foundation that provides grants and funding opportunities for non-profit organizations and individuals.
