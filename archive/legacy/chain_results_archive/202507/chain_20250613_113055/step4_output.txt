**DECISION:** Optimize ML Model Deployment by Implementing Advanced Techniques.

**OPTIONS:**

1. **AutoML:** Utilize automated machine learning tools to simplify the model development and deployment process.
2. **Explainable AI (XAI):** Implement XAI techniques like LIME, SHAP, or Anchors to provide insights into model behavior and improve transparency.
3. **Model Compression:** Apply model compression techniques like quantization, knowledge distillation, or pruning to reduce model size and improve inference speed.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Implement AutoML tools to simplify the model development and deployment process.
- Simplifies the model development process
- Reduces manual effort required for hyperparameter tuning
- Improves model accuracy and performance

**NEXT STEPS:**

□ Assess current infrastructure and identify areas for improvement (Weeks 1-2)
□ Define deployment goals and objectives (Weeks 3-4)
□ Implement AutoML tools and integrate with existing infrastructure (Weeks 5-8)

**WATCH FOR:**
⚠️ Insufficient model performance metrics, leading to suboptimal model updates
⚠️ Inadequate collaboration among team members, hindering knowledge sharing and continuous learning
