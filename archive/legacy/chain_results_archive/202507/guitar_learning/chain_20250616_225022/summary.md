Considering Matthew's background in music and guitar, let's tailor the focus to his creative and collaborative nature while ensuring he's well-prepared for touring.

**Touring Readiness Guitar Skills Focus:**

1. **Instrumental Familiarity:** Refocus on becoming intimately familiar with your instrument, including its unique tone, sustain, and capabilities.
2. **Song-Specific Learning:** Instead of learning a wide range of songs, focus on mastering 3-5 essential tracks for the tour. This will allow you to develop a deeper understanding of your part in each song and improve overall performance.
3. **Riff-Based Repertoire:** Develop a solid foundation in iconic riffs from various genres, including rock, pop, and folk. This will enable you to adapt quickly to new songs and performances.
4. **Chord Progressions:** Focus on common chord progressions used in popular music, such as I-V-vi-IV or ii-V-I. Mastering these progressions will help you navigate different song structures and genres.
5. **Sight-Singing:** Practice sight-singing exercises to improve your ability to learn new songs quickly and accurately. This skill will also benefit you when improvising or making adjustments during performances.

**Touring-Specific Considerations:**

1. **Stage Presence:** Work on developing a more energetic stage presence, including movement, gestures, and interactions with the audience.
2. **Rehearsal Simulations:** Incorporate rehearsal simulations that mimic the tour environment, including lighting, sound checks, and performance logistics.
3. **Adaptability:** Practice adapting to new situations, such as unexpected equipment failures or changes in setlists.

**Personalized Recommendations:**

Considering Matthew's background in music and guitar, I recommend:

* Practicing "Hotel California" by the Eagles for its iconic riffs and chord progression
* Learning a simple but effective fingerpicking pattern to enhance his playing style
* Developing a stronger sense of timing and dynamics to deliver more nuanced performances

By focusing on these areas, Matthew will be well-prepared for touring readiness, blending his musical expertise with the demands of live performance.

## Step 3: performance_anxiety_coach (execution time: 00:17)

As the Performance Anxiety Coach for Mirador, I'd like to expand on the previous output by offering more tailored techniques and strategies to help artists manage their performance anxiety and build stage confidence.

**Techniques for Managing Performance Anxiety:**

1. **Breathing Exercises:** "Mirador's Calming Breath": Before each show, take 5-10 minutes to breathe deeply into your diaphragm, focusing on the sensation of air moving in and out of your body. Inhale for a count of four, hold for a count of seven, and exhale for a count of eight. This will help calm your nerves and center yourself.
2. **Positive Self-Talk Framework:** "The Pre-Show Pep Talk": Write down three positive affirmations about yourself as an artist and performer. Repeat them to yourself before each show, looking yourself in the mirror if possible. Examples might include:
	* "I am well-prepared for this performance."
	* "I trust my skills and abilities."
	* "I am excited to share my art with the audience."
3. **Visualization Exercises:** "The Dream Rehearsal": Imagine yourself performing flawlessly, receiving applause and accolades from the audience. Visualize the energy of the crowd, the thrill of the performance, and the sense of accomplishment after it's over. This will help you build confidence and prepare for potential scenarios.
4. **Progressive Exposure:** "The Comfort Zone Challenge": Gradually expose yourself to situations that make you feel anxious or uncomfortable, starting with small steps. For example, if you're nervous about performing in front of a large crowd, start by speaking in front of a small group or recording yourself singing. As you become more comfortable, gradually increase the size and intensity of your exposure.

**Techniques for Building Stage Confidence:**

1. **Stage Presence Development:** "The Mirror Work": Practice your stage presence by observing yourself from different angles in a mirror. Focus on maintaining good posture, making eye contact with the audience, and using purposeful gestures. Make adjustments as needed to feel more confident and comfortable on stage.
2. **Authenticity Framework:** "The True Self Exercise": Write down what makes you unique and authentic as an artist. Reflect on your values, passions, and experiences that inform your work. This will help you connect with your audience on a deeper level and build trust in yourself as a performer.
3. **Mental Rehearsal Strategies:** "The Rehearsal Routine": Imagine yourself performing in different scenarios, including potential mistakes or challenges. Visualize how you would handle these situations and what adjustments you would make to improve the performance. This will help you feel more prepared and confident on stage.

**Recovery from Performance Mistakes:**

1. **Post-Performance Analysis:** "The Reflection Exercise": After each show, take time to reflect on your performance. Identify what went well and what didn't, and think about how you can improve for the next show. This will help you learn from your mistakes and grow as a performer.
2. **Self-Care Strategies:** "The Recovery Routine": Prioritize self-care after a show by getting enough rest, eating nourishing food, and engaging in activities that bring you joy and relaxation. This will help you recharge and refocus for the next performance.

By incorporating these techniques into your daily routine, you'll be better equipped to manage performance anxiety and build stage confidence. Remember to be patient and kind to yourself as you work through these exercises – it's a process that takes time and practice to develop.
