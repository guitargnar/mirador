Here is an analysis from a previous agent: 

<think>
Alright, so I've been given this task to create a detailed 7-day guitar practice routine focusing on sweep picking, rhythm, and theory. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First off, I know that sweep picking is a technique where you use one direction of the pick to play multiple notes on adjacent strings. It's commonly used in metal and shred guitar. So, for someone looking to improve their sweep picking, they'll need exercises that build muscle memory and control.

Rhythm is another key component here. Rhythmic accuracy is crucial because even if you can sweep perfectly, without a solid rhythm foundation, it might not sound good. So, I should include some rhythm exercises each day to reinforce timing and feel.

Theory-wise, understanding the scales and modes behind the licks will help in composing and improvising. So, integrating theory into practice makes sense. Maybe dedicating part of each day to learning or reviewing a scale or mode related to sweep picking.

Now, structuring this over seven days. I think starting with basic exercises on Day 1, then gradually increasing difficulty each subsequent day. Each day should have a mix of technique work, rhythm exercises, and theory study.

Wait, but the user also mentioned that when working with a feel player, focus on naming what they already know intuitively rather than enforcing theoretical approaches. So, maybe I need to balance between teaching theory and respecting their intuitive playing style.

Also, the tablature should be in standard tuning unless specified otherwise, which is helpful because most of my experience is in standard tuning. However, since it's for death metal, perhaps considering drop tunings might be beneficial, but as per instructions, I'll stick to standard unless told otherwise.

For each day, I can structure the practice into sections: Warm-up, Technique Focus (sweep picking), Rhythm Exercise, Theory Study, and a Cool Down. That way, it's comprehensive and covers all areas without overwhelming the player.

On Day 1, starting with basic sweeps on two strings. Maybe using A minor arpeggios as they're commonly used in metal. Then moving to three strings for more complexity. Rhythm could involve syncopated patterns to challenge timing. Theory-wise, introducing the A minor scale and its modes would be a good start.

Day 2 can build on Day 1 by increasing speed gradually. Maybe incorporating hammer-ons and pull-offs to add articulation. Rhythm exercises with sixteenth notes will help in maintaining consistent tempo. Theory could delve into diminished arpeggios as they're useful for creating tension.

As the days progress, introducing more complex patterns, different scales like harmonic minor, and eventually moving towards composing short licks or solos by Day 7. Each day should also include a cool down to prevent injury and reinforce what was practiced.

I need to ensure that each exercise is explained clearly, with tabs where necessary, and that the theory ties back into why certain scales or modes are used in sweep picking contexts. Also, timing indicators and technique markings in the tabs will be essential for clarity.

Wait, but how much time should each section take? Maybe allocating 15-20 minutes per section, depending on the player's availability. It's important to balance intensity with rest to avoid burnout.

Also, considering that sweep picking can be physically demanding, proper warm-up and cool down are crucial. Maybe suggesting some finger stretches or light exercises before diving into intense sweeps.

I should also include tips for practice efficiency, like using a metronome from Day 1 to build good habits, starting slow and increasing speed gradually, and focusing on clean execution rather than just speed.

In summary, the routine needs to be structured, progressive, and cover all three areas: sweep picking technique, rhythmic accuracy, and theoretical understanding. Each day should build on the previous one, introducing new challenges while reinforcing foundational skills.
