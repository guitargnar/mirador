Here is a condensed executive summary:

**Executive Summary:** To transform the startup's stagnant product development process, we recommend establishing an "Innovation Incubator" framework that harnesses musical collaboration and artistic thinking to break through creative silos. This interdisciplinary platform will facilitate prototyping, feedback, and iteration, unlocking new possibilities from constraints. By fostering a culture of creative experimentation, the team can silence internal dissent, boost employee engagement, and drive growth through innovative product offerings. To achieve this, we will establish a 6-week incubation period with bi-weekly meetings, leveraging Sage's expertise in design thinking and music; identify and allocate time slots for Katie's artistic input; develop a project timeline that aligns with Matthew's work responsibilities and energy limitations; and secure necessary resources to ensure the incubator's success.

And here are the concrete implementation steps:

**Implementation Plan:**

1. **Innovation Incubation Team Assembly**: Schedule a meeting with Matthew, Sage, Katie, and other key stakeholders to define the Incubator's scope, goals, and expectations.
2. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate 2 hours/week for 6 weeks to the Incubator, ensuring sufficient time for collaboration, prototyping, and feedback.
3. **Sage's Expertise Integration**: Schedule bi-weekly meetings with Sage to lead design thinking workshops and musical collaboration sessions.
4. **Katie's Artistic Input**: Identify a regular time slot (e.g., every other Friday) for Katie to contribute her artistic perspective and ideas.
5. **Project Timeline Development**: Create a project timeline that aligns with Matthew's work responsibilities, energy limitations, and incubation schedule.
6. **Incubator Kick-off Meeting**: Schedule a kick-off meeting to introduce the Incubator framework, establish ground rules, and set expectations for the team.
7. **Progress Tracking and Feedback**: Establish a regular feedback loop to monitor progress, identify challenges, and make adjustments to the Incubator framework as needed.

These concrete steps will help transform the startup's product development process into a catalyst for innovation, while fostering a culture of artistic expression and collaborative problem-solving.
