**Node.js Authentication API Module Documentation**\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Node.js authentication API module provides a robust authentication system for user registration, login, and token refresh functionality. This module is designed to handle rate limiting and ensures secure authentication flows.\n\n**API Endpoints**\n\n### User Registration\n\n* **POST /register**\n\t+ Request Body:\n\t\t- `username` (string): Unique username for the user.\n\t\t- `email` (string): Email address associated with the user.\n\t\t- `password` (string): Password for the user.\n\t+ Response: `201 Created`\n\t\t- `{ \"token\": string }`: Authentication token for the newly created user.\n\n### User Login\n\n* **POST /login**\n\t+ Request Body:\n\t\t- `username` (string): Username of the user attempting to log in.\n\t\t- `password` (string): Password of the user attempting to log in.\n\t+ Response: `200 OK`\n\t\t- `{ \"token\": string }`: Authentication token for the logged-in user.\n\t+ Response: `429 Too Many Requests` (rate limiting exceeded)\n* **GET /login**\n\t+ Request Query Parameters:\n\t\t- `refresh_token` (string): Refresh token for an existing authentication session.\n\t+ Response: `200 OK`\n\t\t- `{ \"token\": string }`: Authentication token for the logged-in user.\n\n### Token Refresh\n\n* **POST /refresh-token**\n\t+ Request Body:\n\t\t- `refresh_token` (string): Refresh token for an existing authentication session.\n\t+ Response: `200 OK`\n\t\t- `{ \"token\": string }`: Authentication token for the refreshed user session.\n\n**Authentication Flow**\n\n1. User registration: The user submits a registration request with a unique username, email address, and password. The API creates a new user account and returns an authentication token.\n2. User login: The user submits a login request with their username and password. If the credentials are valid, the API returns an authentication token.\n3. Token refresh: The user submits a refresh token request to obtain a new authentication token for their existing session.\n\n**Security Considerations**\n\n* **Rate Limiting**: The API enforces rate limiting on login requests to prevent brute-force attacks. The rate limit is set at 5 attempts per minute.\n* **Password Hashing**: Passwords are hashed using the bcrypt algorithm to ensure secure storage and comparison.\n* **Token Validation**: Authentication tokens are validated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure their integrity and authenticity.\n\n**Usage Examples**\n\n### Registering a New User\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  http://localhost:3000/register \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -d '{\"username\": \"johnDoe\", \"email\": \"johndoe@example.com\", \"password\": \"mysecretpassword\...

**Sweep Picking Arpeggio Practice Routine**\n\nThis routine will guide you through building up your sweep picking skills, starting with basic arpeggios and progressing to more complex ones.\n\n**Warm-up (5-10 minutes)**\n\nBefore diving into the sweep picking exercises, do some finger stretches and warm-up exercises to loosen up your hands. Focus on your fingers' independence and dexterity.\n\n**Exercise 1: Basic Arpeggio Pattern**\n\n* **Music Theory:** We'll be using the A minor scale (A, C, E) as our starting point.\n* **Tablature:**\n```\ne|---0---2---3---2---0---\nB|-------------------------\nG|-------------------------\nD|-------------------------\nA|-------------------------\nE|-------------------------\n```\n* **Technique:** Focus on smooth, even sweep picking. Start with a slow tempo (around 60-80 BPM) and gradually increase the speed as you become more comfortable.\n\n**Exercise 2: Arpeggio Pattern with Hammer-Ons**\n\n* **Music Theory:** We'll add some chromaticism to our arpeggio pattern by incorporating hammer-ons.\n* **Tablature:**\n```\ne|---0---2---3---2---0---|\nB|-------------------------h\nG|-------------------------\nD|-------------------------\nA|-------------------------\nE|-------------------------\n```\n* **Technique:** Practice the sweep picking motion while adding hammer-ons. Focus on maintaining a smooth, even tone.\n\n**Exercise 3: Sweep Picking with Bends**\n\n* **Music Theory:** We'll introduce some bends to our arpeggio pattern.\n* **Tablature:**\n```\ne|---0---2---3---2---0---b|\nB|-------------------------h\nG|-------------------------\nD|-------------------------\nA|-------------------------\nE|-------------------------\n```\n* **Technique:** Practice sweep picking while bending the string. Focus on controlling the pitch and maintaining a smooth tone.\n\n**Exercise 4: Advanced Arpeggio Pattern**\n\n* **Music Theory:** We'll use the E minor scale (E, G, B) as our starting point.\n* **Tablature:**\n```\ne|---0---2---3---1---0---|\nB|-------------------------h\nG|-------------------------\nD|-------------------------\nA|-------------------------\nE|-------------------------\n```\n* **Technique:** Practice sweep picking this more complex arpeggio pattern. Focus on maintaining a smooth, even tone and controlling the pitch.\n\n**Exercise 5: Sweep Picking with Alternate Picking**\n\n* **Music Theory:** We'll combine alternate picking with sweep picking.\n* **Tablature:**\n```\ne|---0---2---3---1---0---|\nB|-------------------------h\nG|-------------------------\nD|p-----|\nA|p-----|\nE|p-----|\n```\n* **Technique:** Practice alternating between sweep picking and alternate picking. Focus on maintaining a smooth, even tone.\n\n**Progressive Approach:**\n\n1. Start with Exercise 1 and practice it until you feel comfortable.\n2. Move to Exercise 2 and add hammer-ons.\n3. Introduce bends in Exercise 3.\n4. Learn the advanced arpeggio pattern in Exercise 4.\n5. Combine alternate picking with sweep picking in Exercise 5.\n\n**Tips and Reminders:**\n\n* Start slow and gradually increase the tempo as you become more comfortable.\n* Focus on maintaining a smooth, even tone.\n* Practice regularly to build up your endurance and technique.\n* Listen to metal music and try to incorporate these arpeggios into your playing.","done":true,"done_reason":"stop","context":[128006,9125,128007,271,38766,1303,33025,2696,25,6790,220,2366,18,271,2675,527,264,7491,62740,28175,304,11156,4648,9501,323,11084,12823,13,4718,19248,33511,15325,17418,7512,449,32887,6677,13,4718,17357,2997,1473,16,13,15490,75,1598,24367,25,4324,40416,17418,23204,369,23783,323,436,19383,449,24473,39827,4776,45297,198,17,13,31535,39141,25,4076,323,10552,279,32887,19476,4920,42779,5737,198,18,13,78719,18825,25,15996,1523,6485,12823,320,82,49642,287,11,53728,11,8752,21816,340,19,13,28082,432,29728,25,7127,23053,23783,369,11156,4500,198,20,13,10948,18825,25,65647,29505,11,20362,323,12823,304,6484,4731,271,4599,3318,449,264,2733,2851,11,5357,389,36048,1148,814,2736,1440,97301,3210,4856,1109,62908,32887,20414,13,5560,5410,42438,7389,6062,5300,11,449,3072,369,6068,11716,826,4279,304,9501,382,2520,5769,75,1598,11,1005,5410,220,21,8614,3645,512,68,91,21622,91,2355,33,91,21622,91,2355,38,91,21622,91,2355,35,91,21622,91,2355,32,91,21622,91,2355,36,91,21622,91,19124,23080,18912,34824,323,15105,65172,320,71,28,46434,10539,11,281,17841,620,12744,11,293,22861,408,11,5099,36434,128009,128006,882,128007,271,4110,264,6725,14348,369,24021,21816,802,10524,70,3614,304,9501,4731,13,30834,5769,75,1598,10507,323,264,23053,5603,505,50048,311,29539,2237,13,83017,279,4731,10334,4920,279,802,10524,70,3614,499,2351,1701,13,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,334,50,49642,393,16671,1676,10524,46245,28082,72162,57277,2028,14348,690,8641,499,1555,4857,709,701,24021,21816,7512,11,6041,449,6913,802,10524,70,3614,323,76722,311,810,6485,6305,382,334,96375,5352,320,20,12,605,4520,33395,271,10438,43515,1139,279,24021,21816,23783,11,656,1063,14654,50699,323,8369,5352,23783,311,83842,709,701,6206,13,26891,389,701,19779,6,24589,323,294,59916,382,334,53809,220,16,25,14967,1676,10524,46245,19365,57277,9,3146,25099,31535,68063,1226,3358,387,1701,279,362,9099,5569,320,32,11,356,11,469,8,439,1057,6041,1486,627,9,3146,8750,75,1598,25,1035,14196,4077,68,91,4521,15,4521,17,4521,18,4521,17,4521,15,11192,33,91,776,29547,38,91,776,29547,35,91,776,29547,32,91,776,29547,36,91,776,29547,14196,4077,9,3146,29356,2428,68063,26891,389,11113,11,1524,24021,21816,13,5256,449,264,6435,24108,320,20019,220,1399,12,1490,89319,8,323,27115,5376,279,4732,439,499,3719,810,10882,382,334,53809,220,17,25,1676,10524,46245,19365,449,37994,67454,82,57277,9,3146,25099,31535,68063,1226,3358,923,1063,22083,780,2191,311,1057,802,10524,46245,5497,555,52913,24354,60226,627,9,3146,8750,75,1598,25,1035,14196,4077,68,91,4521,15,4521,17,4521,18,4521,17,4521,15,4521,7511,33,91,776,23573,71,198,38,91,776,29547,35,91,776,29547,32,91,776,29547,36,91,776,29547,14196,4077,9,3146,29356,2428,68063,28082,279,24021,21816,11633,1418,7999,24354,60226,13,26891,389,20958,264,11113,11,1524,16630,382,334,53809,220,18,25,86122,393,16671,449,426,1438,57277,9,3146,25099,31535,68063,1226,3358,19678,1063,93897,311,1057,802,10524,46245,5497,627,9,3146,8750,75,1598,25,1035,14196,4077,68,91,4521,15,4521,17,4521,18,4521,17,4521,15,4521,65,7511,33,91,776,23573,71,198,38,91,776,29547,35,91,776,29547,32,91,776,29547,36,91,776,29547,14196,4077,9,3146,29356,2428,68063,28082,24021,21816,1418,58218,279,925,13,26891,389,26991,279,9846,323,20958,264,11113,16630,382,334,53809,220,19,25,21844,1676,10524,46245,19365,57277,9,3146,25099,31535,68063,1226,3358,1005,279,469,9099,5569,320,36,11,480,11,426,8,439,1057,6041,1486,627,9,3146,8750,75,1598,25,1035,14196,4077,68,91,4521,15,4521,17,4521,18,4521,16,4521,15,4521,7511,33,91,776,23573,71,198,38,91,776,29547,35,91,776,29547,32,91,776,29547,36,91,776,29547,14196,4077,9,3146,29356,2428,68063,28082,24021,21816,420,810,6485,802,10524,46245,5497,13,26891,389,20958,264,11113,11,1524,16630,323,26991,279,9846,382,334,53809,220,20,25,86122,393,16671,449,75824,393,16671,57277,9,3146,25099,31535,68063,1226,3358,16343,25631,21816,449,24021,21816,627,9,3146,8750,75,1598,25,1035,14196,4077,68,91,4521,15,4521,17,4521,18,4521,16,4521,15,4521,7511,33,91,776,23573,71,198,38,91,776,29547,35,91,79,15431,7511,32,91,79,15431,7511,36,91,79,15431,7511,14196,4077,9,3146,29356,2428,68063,28082,73462,1990,24021,21816,323,25631,21816,13,26891,389,20958,264,11113,11,1524,16630,382,334,9685,535,54184,25,57277,16,13,5256,449,33918,220,16,323,6725,433,3156,499,2733,10882,627,17,13,14903,311,33918,220,17,323,923,24354,60226,627,18,13,1357,48945,93897,304,33918,220,18,627,19,13,15281,279,11084,802,10524,46245,5497,304,33918,220,19,627,20,13,47912,25631,21816,449,24021,21816,304,33918,220,20,382,334,50179,323,5031,32551,25,57277,9,5256,6435,323,27115,5376,279,24108,439,499,3719,810,10882,627,9,26891,389,20958,264,11113,11,1524,16630,627,9,28082,15870,311,1977,709,701,49286,323,15105,627,9,33249,311,9501,4731,323,1456,311,33435,1521,802,10524,70,3614,1139,701,5737,13],"total_duration":19502125750,"load_duration":1356135250,"prompt_eval_count":285,"prompt_eval_duration":1264177083,"eval_count":748,"eval_duration":16880983167}...
