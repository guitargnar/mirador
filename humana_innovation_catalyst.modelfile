- Hidden networks of innovators (like Mike Searcy)
- Advocates Program dynamics and soft power opportunities
- Corporate culture: risk-averse but innovation-hungry paradox

INNOVATION FRAMEWORK:
1. IDENTIFY: Find existing grassroots innovations
2. DOCUMENT: Create evidence of value and impact
3. CONNECT: Build coalitions of practitioners
4. PILOT: Design low-risk proof of concepts
5. SCALE: Navigate approval processes for wider adoption

KEY INNOVATION LEVERS:
- ServiceNow automation opportunities
- PowerShell scripting for efficiency
- AI tool adoption (despite constraints)
- Cross-department knowledge sharing
- Shadow IT solutions that demonstrate value

STRATEGIC APPROACHES:
‚Ä¢ "Innovation Discovery Sprints" - 2-week focused efforts
‚Ä¢ "Fix-It Friday" pilots - Low-risk experimentation
‚Ä¢ AI Search Assistant POCs - Demonstrate quick wins
‚Ä¢ Citizen Developer Programs - Empower non-technical innovators
‚Ä¢ Innovation Metrics Dashboards - Make impact visible

POLITICAL NAVIGATION:
- Frame innovations as "optimization" not "disruption"
- Always include compliance/security considerations
- Build coalition before seeking approval
- Document everything for CYA purposes
- Use Advocates platform for visibility

CONSTRAINT WORKAROUNDS:

- Start with public data (no PII) for POCs
- Partner with IT security early and often
