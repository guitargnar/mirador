To create a simple yet effective AI for generating artist-style chord progressions, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Research** - Understand the style of artists whose work inspires your project by listening to their music and analyzing common patterns in their compositions. Look into existing tools or software that analyze musical styles for reference (e.g., Melodia, Sonic Pi).

2. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** - Gather a dataset consisting of songs from the target artists with annotated chord progressions if available; otherwise, you may need to transcribe them manually using music notation software like MuseScore or Lilypond. Use Python libraries such as `music2

Let's dive deeper into building your artist-style chord progression generator.

**1. Research: Beyond the Basics**

* **Deep Dive into Harmony:**  Don't just listen – analyze. Identify specific harmonic devices the artist uses: 
    * **Chord types:**  Are they favoring major, minor, diminished, augmented chords? How do they use seventh chords and sus chords?
    * **Common progressions:** Look for recurring patterns. Are there signature IV-V-I sequences, ii-V-I jazz progressions, or unique progressions specific to the artist's style? 
    * **Voice Leading:**  Pay attention to how melodies move between chords. Is it smooth and stepwise, or more dissonant and leaping? This can give you clues about their harmonic language.

* **Genre Context:** The artist's genre heavily influences their chord choices. Consider:
    * **Typical progressions:** Pop music often uses simpler, catchy progressions, while jazz may be more complex and improvisational.
    * **Scales and Modes:**  Does the artist primarily use major or minor scales? Do they incorporate modes like Dorian or Phrygian for a distinct flavor?

**2. Data Collection & Preprocessing: Accuracy is Key**

* **Annotation Importance:** If you're using existing datasets, ensure the chord annotations are accurate. Inaccuracies will directly impact your AI's learning.
* **Manual Transcription:**

Building an AI-powered music composition tool sounds like an exciting project! Given your Python background and basic music theory knowledge, you'll be well on your way to creating a chord progression generator in the style of specific artists. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

**Step 1: Research and Data Collection**

* Study the music styles, genres, and chord progressions of the artists you want to emulate. Listen to their songs and analyze their chord progressions.
* Collect a dataset of chord progressions from these artists. You can use existing datasets or transcribe chord progressions from sheet music or online resources like MuseScore or SecondHandSongs.
* Consider collecting metadata about each progression, such as the song title, artist, genre, tempo, and time signature.

**Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

* Clean and preprocess your dataset by:
	+ Normalizing chord names (e.g., C to c) and transposing to a common key.
	+ Removing duplicate progressions or unnecessary chord changes.
	+ Converting chord progressions into numerical representations (e.g., sequences of numbers representing chord functions, e.g., I-IV-V).

Popular libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing in Python are:

* `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
* `numpy` for numerical computations
* `scipy` for scientific computing and data processing

**Step 3: Music Theory and Representation**

* Learn more about music theory, particularly chord progressions, voice leading, and harmonic function.
* Represent your chord progressions using a suitable format, such as:
	+ MIDI files (using libraries like `mido` or `music21`)
	+ Musical notation (using libraries like `Music21` or `Lyrics`)

**Step 4: AI Model Selection and Training**

* Choose an AI model architecture that can learn from your dataset, such as:
	+ Neural networks (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN))
	+ Deep learning models specifically designed for music generation (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs))
* Train your model using a suitable optimization algorithm and loss function, such as:
	+ Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cross-Entropy Loss for regression tasks
	+ Binary Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks
