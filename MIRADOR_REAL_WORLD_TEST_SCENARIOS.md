## 🌅 Daily Operational Excellence Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Monday Morning Strategic Planning
**Context**: It's Monday morning, you have a busy week ahead with key meetings and deliverables.

```bash
# Test Command 1: Morning Strategic Alignment
./humana_chain_runner.sh strategic_synthesis "Today is Monday, January 8, 2025. My calendar shows: 9am Risk Management team meeting, 11am 1-on-1 with manager, 2pm Advocates Program meeting, 3pm IT Security review. My top 3 priorities this week are: 1) Complete Q1 risk assessment automation, 2) Build support for Mirador expansion, 3) Position for AI Center of Excellence role. Given these constraints and opportunities, what are the 3 highest-leverage actions I should take today? Consider both visible wins and behind-the-scenes positioning. Account for political dynamics with my manager Sarah, peer relationships with Mike Searcy, and executive visibility opportunities with Dalia Powers."

# Test Command 2: Quick Win Identification
./humana_chain_runner.sh quick_win_generator "I have 2 hours this morning before meetings. What's a quick automation I can build for Risk Management that would: 1) Save immediate time for the team, 2) Be visible in today's team meeting, 3) Demonstrate AI capability without revealing full Mirador scope?"
```

### Scenario 2: Pre-Meeting Intelligence Preparation
**Context**: You have a critical meeting with IT Security about your automation tools.

```bash
# Test Command 3: IT Security Navigation
./humana_chain_runner.sh corporate_nav "I have a meeting with IT Security Director Tom Wilson in 30 minutes about my 'automation tools.' His priorities are zero security incidents and compliance. He might be concerned about unauthorized AI usage and data exposure. How should I navigate this conversation to: 1) Show complete compliance, 2) Address security concerns proactively, 3) Plant seeds for future AI tool approval, 4) Convert him from gatekeeper to enabler? Give me specific phrases to use and technical points to emphasize."

# Test Command 4: Compliance Documentation
./humana_chain_runner.sh solution_design "Create a one-page security compliance document for my automation tools that shows: 1) No external data transmission, 2) All processing happens locally, 3) Alignment with Humana security policies, 4) Benefits to security posture through reduced human error. Make it technical enough to be credible but accessible to non-technical executives."
```

## 🚀 Innovation Discovery & Expansion Scenarios

### Scenario 3: Identifying New Automation Opportunities
**Context**: You've successfully automated Risk Management processes and need to expand strategically.

```bash
# Test Command 5: Department Analysis
./humana_chain_runner.sh innovation_discovery "Mirador has reduced Risk Management processing time by 75%. Looking at adjacent departments: Claims Processing (manual Excel reconciliation), Provider Relations (manual credentialing checks), Member Services (repetitive email responses), Finance (manual report generation). Which department should be next? Consider: 1) Political feasibility with current allies, 2) Technical complexity, 3) Star Ratings impact, 4) Visibility to executives, 5) Path to AI COE role. Rank top 3 with specific approach for each."

# Test Command 6: Pilot Proposal Generation

Potential supporters: Sarah Williams (Provider Relations), David Park (Member Services). Likely resistors: Bob Stevens (Traditional IT). What's my optimal presentation strategy? Should I: 1) Demo Mirador openly, 2) Share 'lessons learned' without naming the tool, 3) Have Mike share his experience? What specific examples and metrics would create FOMO without triggering antibodies?"

# Test Command 8: Pain Point Collection Strategy
./humana_chain_runner.sh advocates_strategy "I want to use the Advocates meeting to collect enterprise-wide pain points for Mirador expansion. Create a subtle survey/discussion framework that: 1) Gets people to share their biggest time wasters, 2) Identifies automation opportunities, 3) Builds demand for solutions, 4) Positions me as the problem-solver, 5) Creates follow-up opportunities. Include specific questions and facilitation techniques."
