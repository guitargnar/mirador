# Future Enhancements for Mirador Framework

This document outlines planned enhancements to the Mirador framework based on insights from the emergent multi-agent collaboration system.

## System Architecture Enhancements

### 1. Dynamic Agent Selection
- Implement a "conductor" agent that analyzes tasks and selects only relevant specialists
- Auto-skip unnecessary personas based on task context
- Create a decision tree for optimal specialist selection
- Develop heuristics for when to include specific specialists

### 2. Bidirectional Communication
- Allow specialists to request information from each other rather than just passing forward
- Create feedback loops where later specialists can suggest modifications to earlier work
- Implement a message passing protocol between specialists
- Build a centralized context manager to facilitate cross-agent communication

### 3. Knowledge Persistence
- Store and index specialist outputs for reuse across multiple projects
- Develop a shared knowledge base that evolves with each project
- Implement retrieval mechanisms for relevant past solutions
- Create domain-specific libraries of solutions and patterns

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Chain-of-Thought Standardization
- Create a structured format for reasoning capture to enable analysis across specialists
- Track which ideas in planning translate to implementation
- Implement a tagging system for tracking concepts through the specialist chain
- Develop visualization tools for the evolution of ideas

### 2. Evaluation Metrics
- Measure the value added by each specialist (how much they modified/enhanced)
- Score coherence between specialists' contributions
- Implement automated test generation for verifying specialist outputs
- Create a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement

### 3. Parallel Processing
- Run compatible specialists in parallel for efficiency
- Implement a merging mechanism for reconciling parallel contributions
- Develop a conflict resolution system for contradicting specialist advice
- Create an orchestration layer for managing resource allocation

## Applications and Use Cases

### 1. Domain-Specific Chains
- Create pre-configured specialist sequences for common workflows (software development, research, content creation)
- Allow user-defined specialist sequences for custom workflows
- Develop templates for domain-specific tasks
- Implement configuration profiles for different industries

### 2. Interactive Decision Points
- Add more interactive checkpoints for users to guide the specialist chain
- Allow branching into different specialist pathways based on user feedback
- Implement a guidance interface for steering the development process
- Create an explanation system for specialist recommendations

### 3. Self-Critique Mode
- Add a final "critic" persona that evaluates the entire chain output
- Implement automated revision cycles based on critic feedback
- Develop benchmarks for quality assessment
- Enable comparison between different specialist combinations

## User Experience

### 1. Progress Visualization
- Create a UI showing how each specialist transforms the project
- Visualize which sections were modified by which specialists
- Implement a diff view for tracking changes between specialists
- Develop a timeline view of the development process

### 2. Specialist Profiles
- Display performance metrics and specialization details for each agent
- Allow users to customize specialist behavior based on project needs
- Create a specialist marketplace for sharing custom configurations
- Implement a rating system for specialist effectiveness

### 3. Output Formats
- Support multiple output formats (code, documentation, diagrams)
- Implement export mechanisms for different platforms
- Create templating system for consistent outputs
- Develop integration plugins for common development environments
