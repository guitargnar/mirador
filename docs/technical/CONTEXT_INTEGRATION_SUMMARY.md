## 🎯 Real-World Test Examples

### **Before vs After Context**

#### **Before** (Incomplete Context):
```bash
./mirador_universal_runner.sh relationship_harmony "How do I handle relationship challenges?"
# Generic relationship advice
```

#### **After** (Complete Story Context):
```bash
./mirador_universal_runner.sh relationship_harmony "How do I navigate building a relationship with Katie while ensuring Sage feels secure and my pattern recognition doesn't sabotage trust?"
# Specific guidance based on your childhood trauma, current family dynamics, 
# Katie's lack of children experience, and your learned hypervigilance
```

### **Financial Planning Example:**
```bash
./mirador_universal_runner.sh business_acceleration "I want to invest my $91K home equity but I have 401k loans reducing my take-home to $1,650. How do I build wealth while ensuring Sage has stability?"
# Now understands: exact equity amount, specific income constraints, 
# single father priorities, co-parenting costs with Carey/Angela
```

### **Creative Integration Example:**
```bash
./mirador_universal_runner.sh creative_breakthrough "How do I apply the collaborative patterns I learned from Annapurna's 9-year run to scaling Mirador as a business framework?"
# Now understands: specific band history, collaboration evolution,
# musical influence on AI orchestration, real creative timeline
```
