To create your AI-powered music composition tool, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Research existing projects or papers on similar topics for inspiration and guidance. Look into works like Google's Magenta project which focuses on using machine learning in the arts.
2. Define clear objectives such as target artists whose styles are desired, types of music (genres), and specific aspects you want to capture from their chord progressions.
3. Acquire a dataset that includes notations or audio recordings with labeled data representing your chosen artist's style for training purposes if available; otherwise, consider creating one by transcribing the target artistsâ€™ pieces into music notation software like MuseScore

Let's dive deeper into building your AI-powered chord progression generator:

**1. Inspiration & Research:**

* **Beyond Magenta:** While Magenta is a great starting point, explore other projects like Jukebox (OpenAI) for its text-to-music capabilities and Amper Music for its focus on commercially viable compositions.  Analyze their architectures, datasets, and strengths/weaknesses. 
* **Music Information Retrieval (MIR):** This field is crucial for your project. Understand techniques like feature extraction (pitch contours, rhythmic patterns), chord recognition, and genre classification. Libraries like Librosa and Essentia can be invaluable here.

**2. Defining Objectives:**

* **Specificity is Key:** Instead of "style of specific artists,"  narrow it down. Do you want to capture the melancholic progressions of a singer-songwriter, the complex harmonies of a jazz composer, or the driving rhythms of an electronic artist? 
* **Measurable Goals:** Define what success looks like. Can your AI generate progressions that are:
    * Harmonically consistent within a specific genre?
    * Structurally similar to the target artist's compositions (verse-chorus, etc.)?
    * Able to evoke the desired emotional tone?

**3. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

* **Public Datasets:** Explore platforms like Kaggle and GitHub for existing music datasets. 
* **Web Scraping:** Carefully consider ethical implications but targeted web scraping

Building an AI-powered music composition tool sounds like an exciting project. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

**Step 1: Research and Inspiration**

* Study existing projects and papers on music generation, such as:
	+ Google's Magenta project (specifically their chord progression generator)
	+ OpenAI's Jukebox
	+ Amper Music
	+ Music21 (a Python library for music theory and analysis)
* Look into music information retrieval (MIR) techniques, feature extraction, and audio processing. Familiarize yourself with:
	+ Librosa (audio signal processing)
	+ Essentia (audio feature extraction)
	+ Music21 (music theory and notation)

**Step 2: Define Your Objectives**

* Identify the specific artists whose styles you want to emulate
* Decide on the types of music (genres) and chord progressions you want to generate
* Determine what makes an artist's style unique (e.g., melancholic, complex harmonies, driving rhythms)
* Set measurable goals for your AI-generated progressions, such as:
	+ Harmonic consistency within a specific genre
	+ Structural similarity to the target artist's compositions
	+ Emotional tone evocation

**Step 3: Choose Libraries and Tools**

* Python libraries:
	+ NumPy and SciPy for numerical computations
	+ Librosa and Essentia for audio processing (optional)
	+ Music21 for music theory and notation
	+ TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning (if you want to build a neural network-based model)
* Music generation libraries:
	+ Magenta (available on Google Colab) for chord progression generation
	+ Jukebox (available on GitHub) for text-to-music capabilities
	+ Amper Music (available online) for commercially viable compositions

**Step 4: Prepare Your Data**

* Collect a dataset of chord progressions in the style of your target artists. You can:
	+ Use publicly available datasets like the MIDI Archive or the Open Music Library
	+ Transcribe your own recordings or sheet music
	+ Create a dataset from online resources, such as song structures and chord charts
* Preprocess your data by:
	+ Normalizing chord progressions (e.g., using a standard 12-tone equal temperament)
	+ Extracting relevant features (e.g., pitch contours, rhythmic patterns)
