## Quick Setup Commands:

```bash
# Create all enhanced models
ollama create matthew_advisor_enhanced -f matthew_advisor_enhanced.modelfile
ollama create matthew_realestate_enhanced -f matthew_realestate_enhanced.modelfile
ollama create matthew_career_enhanced -f matthew_career_enhanced.modelfile
ollama create matthew_parenting_enhanced -f matthew_parenting_enhanced.modelfile
ollama create matthew_louisville_enhanced -f matthew_louisville_enhanced.modelfile
```

## Advanced Usage Patterns:

### 1. Multi-Model Decision Making:
```bash
# Get financial perspective
ollama run matthew_advisor_enhanced "Should I use home equity for investment?"

# Get real estate analysis
ollama run matthew_realestate_enhanced "Analyze using $91k equity for Louisville rental property"

# Get career impact assessment
ollama run matthew_career_enhanced "How would real estate investment affect my Humana exit strategy?"
```

### 2. Long-Form Planning Sessions:
```bash
# Extended conversation with full context retention
ollama run matthew_realestate_enhanced
# Then have a 20+ message conversation about specific properties, financing, etc.
# The model will remember everything discussed
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring:
```bash
# Check model performance
ollama ps

# Monitor system resources
htop

# Check GPU utilization (if applicable)
nvidia-smi  # or equivalent for M3 Max monitoring
```

## System Optimization Tips:

### Memory Management:
- Close unnecessary applications before running multiple models
- Use Activity Monitor to track memory usage
- Consider running one primary model with others on standby

### Thermal Management:
- Monitor CPU temperature during extended sessions
- Use cooling pad if running intensive multi-model sessions
- Take breaks between long planning sessions

### Storage Considerations:
- Each enhanced model ~4-8GB storage
- Keep SSD space available for optimal performance
- Regular cleanup of old model versions

## Troubleshooting:

### If Models Run Slowly:
1. Reduce `num_batch` by 50%
2. Lower `num_ctx` to 16384-24576
3. Decrease `num_thread` to 6

### If Memory Issues:
1. Run one model at a time
2. Reduce context length
3. Close other applications

### If Responses Seem Repetitive:
1. Increase `repeat_penalty` to 1.2
2. Adjust `top_p` down to 0.8
3. Increase `top_k` to 60

## Model Update Strategy:

```bash
# Backup current models
ollama list > my_models_backup.txt

# Update system prompts as circumstances change
# Edit modelfile, then:
ollama create matthew_advisor_enhanced -f matthew_advisor_enhanced.modelfile

# Remove old versions if needed
ollama rm matthew_advisor_old
```

Your M3 Max is perfectly suited for these enhanced configurations. The unified memory architecture and high-performance cores will make these models significantly more capable than the basic versions.
