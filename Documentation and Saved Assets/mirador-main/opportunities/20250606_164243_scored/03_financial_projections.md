**Monthly Expenses:**

2. Fuel and Maintenance:
	* $500/month (fuel, maintenance, repairs)

5. Employee Salaries (assuming 2-3 employees):
	* $6,667/month (assuming $25/hour x 40 hours/week x 4 weeks/month)
6. Miscellaneous:
	* $1,000/month (office expenses, miscellaneous supplies)

Total Monthly Expenses: $13,334

**Revenue Projections:**

Assuming an average sale of $15 per customer and a daily capacity of 50 customers, the revenue projections are:

Year 1:

* Average monthly sales: $60,000
* Revenue growth rate: 10%

Year 2:

* Average monthly sales: $66,000 (10% increase from Year 1)
* Revenue growth rate: 5%

Year 3:

* Average monthly sales: $69,900 (5% increase from Year 2)

**Break-Even Analysis:**

Assuming a startup cost of $152,000 and a monthly expense of $13,334, the break-even analysis is:

* Break-even point: approximately 11 months after opening
* Revenue required to break even: $1,732,000 (assuming 12 months x $13,334/month)

**Louisville Market Rates:**

Based on Louisville market rates, here are some assumptions for pricing and revenue projections:

* Average entree price: $10-$15
* Average drink price: $3-$5
* Average dessert price: $5-$7

Assuming an average sale of $15 per customer, the revenue projections are based on a 20% profit margin.

**Local Resources and Opportunities:**

1. Louisville Metro:
	* Food truck permits and licenses can be obtained through the City of Louisville's Business License Office.
2. JCPS:
	* Food trucks may be allowed in school zones with proper permits and approvals.
3. TARC:
	* Food trucks may be allowed at TARC bus stops or events with proper permits and approvals.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Secure funding for startup costs through loans, investors, or personal savings.
2. Obtain necessary licenses and permits from the City of Louisville and Jefferson County.
3. Purchase or lease a food truck that meets local health and safety regulations.
4. Develop a marketing strategy to attract customers and build brand awareness.
5. Hire staff and train employees on menu preparation, customer service, and cash handling.
