# Mirador Development Priorities Analysis

## Current Gaps Analysis

Based on my comprehensive review of Mirador's capabilities and personal life automation potential, here are the key gaps:

### 1. Domain Specialist Models Missing
- **Financial Planning Specialist**: No model specifically trained in personal finance, budgeting, investment strategies
- **Parenting/Education Specialist**: No model with child development, educational methodology expertise
- **Health/Wellness Specialist**: No model focused on nutrition, fitness, mental health
- **Home Management Specialist**: No model for maintenance, energy efficiency, home improvement

### 2. Local Knowledge Integration
- No systematic way to incorporate Louisville/Jefferson County specific information
- Limited ability to research and maintain local regulations, resources, opportunities
- No integration with local APIs or data sources

### 3. Personal Context Management
- No persistent memory of user preferences, family dynamics, personal goals
- Limited ability to maintain context across multiple automation sessions
- No personalization beyond single-session interactions

### 4. Implementation and Tracking Tools
- Strong at generating plans but limited follow-through automation
- No built-in progress tracking or habit formation support
- Limited integration with existing personal management tools

### 5. Family/Multi-User Coordination
- Designed for single-user interaction
- No family member role management or permission systems
- Limited collaborative planning capabilities

## Priority Development Opportunities

### HIGHEST PRIORITY: Financial Planning Specialist Model

**Why This First:**
- Aligns perfectly with Mirador's analytical strengths

**Specific Action Plan:**
1. Create the financial_planning_expert.modelfile (I can help draft this)
2. Test with real financial scenarios (budget optimization, investment planning)
3. Iterate based on results
4. Once proven, expand to other specialist domains

This approach gives you immediate value while building toward comprehensive personal life automation.



## Detailed Implementation Recommendations

Based on the terminal output analysis, here are the most valuable next steps for Mirador development, prioritized by immediate impact and feasibility:

### Priority 1: Performance Optimization (Immediate - High Impact)

The terminal output reveals that enhanced_agent consistently times out in chains (120 seconds with minimal output), which breaks the chain orchestration that is core to Mirador's value proposition. This is the most critical issue to address.

**Specific Actions:**

1. **Create Chain-Optimized Model Variants**
   ```bash
   # enhanced_agent_fast.modelfile
   FROM enhanced_agent
   
   PARAMETER temperature 0.5
   PARAMETER top_p 0.8
   PARAMETER num_predict 1500
   PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1
   
   SYSTEM """You are an enhanced analysis agent optimized for chain collaboration. 
   Provide focused, actionable insights in under 1000 words. 
   Structure responses for easy handoff to subsequent models.
   Avoid excessive elaboration - prioritize key insights and clear recommendations."""
   ```

2. **Implement Dynamic Timeout Configuration**
   ```python
   # Add to mirador.py
   MODEL_TIMEOUTS = {
       'enhanced_agent': 300,
       'enhanced_agent_fast': 90,
       'llama3.2_balanced': 60,
       'master_coder': 120,
       'creative_entrepreneur': 90,
       'fast_agent_focused': 30
   }
   ```

3. **Add Timeout Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Implement graceful timeout handling that preserves partial outputs
   - Add automatic retry with simplified prompts
   - Create fallback model selection for failed chain steps

### Priority 2: Financial Planning Specialist (Week 1-2 - High Value)

Given the performance insights, create a financial specialist optimized for reliable chain execution rather than maximum analytical depth.

**Implementation Strategy:**

```bash
# financial_planning_expert.modelfile
FROM llama3.2_balanced

PARAMETER temperature 0.3
PARAMETER top_p 0.9
PARAMETER num_predict 2000
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.05

SYSTEM """You are a certified financial planning expert with deep knowledge of:

CORE EXPERTISE:
- Personal budgeting and expense optimization
- Investment strategies for different life stages and risk tolerances
- Tax planning and optimization (federal, state, and local)
- Retirement planning and wealth building strategies
- Insurance and risk management
- Debt management and credit optimization
- Emergency fund planning and cash flow management

LOUISVILLE/KENTUCKY SPECIALIZATION:
- Kentucky state tax implications and deductions
- Local cost of living factors and regional salary benchmarks
- Louisville housing market trends and property tax considerations
- Regional banking options and credit union benefits
- Local investment opportunities and economic factors

```

**Test Chain for Financial Planning:**
```bash
mirador-ez chain "Optimize monthly budget for Louisville family of 4 with $75k income" financial_planning_expert master_coder
```

### Priority 3: Local Knowledge Integration System (Week 2-3 - Medium-High Value)

Create a systematic approach to incorporating Louisville-specific information into all recommendations.

**Implementation Approach:**

1. **Create Louisville Knowledge Specialist**
   ```bash
   # louisville_expert.modelfile
   FROM enhanced_agent_fast
   
   SYSTEM """You are a Louisville, Kentucky local expert with comprehensive knowledge of:
   
   - Jefferson County government services and resources
   - Louisville Metro housing market and neighborhoods
   - Local school districts (JCPS) and educational resources
   - Healthcare systems (Norton, Baptist, UofL, etc.)
   - Local business environment and economic development
   - Cultural resources and community organizations
   - Transportation systems (TARC, airport, highways)
   - Local tax implications and incentives
   - Weather patterns and seasonal considerations
   - Regional cost of living and salary benchmarks
   
   Always provide specific local resources, contact information, and actionable next steps."""
   ```

2. **Integrate Local Context into Existing Chains**
   ```bash
   # Example enhanced chain for home ownership
   mirador-ez chain "Home buying strategy for Louisville first-time buyer" louisville_expert financial_planning_expert master_coder
   ```

### Priority 4: Personal Context Memory System (Week 3-4 - Medium Value)

Implement persistent user profiles and preferences to enable true personalization across sessions.

**Technical Implementation:**

1. **User Profile System**
   ```python
   # Add to mirador.py
   class UserProfile:
       def __init__(self, profile_path):
           self.profile_path = profile_path
           self.data = self.load_profile()
       
       def load_profile(self):
           # Load user preferences, family info, goals, etc.
           pass
       
       def update_context(self, domain, key, value):
           # Update user context for specific domains
           pass
   ```

2. **Context-Aware Prompting**
   - Inject relevant user context into model prompts
   - Maintain conversation history across sessions
   - Track progress on long-term goals and projects

### Priority 5: Implementation and Tracking Tools (Week 4-5 - Medium Value)

Create tools that help users actually implement and track the recommendations from Mirador chains.

**Specific Tools:**

1. **Habit Tracking Integration**
   ```bash
   # habit_tracker.modelfile
   FROM master_coder
   
   SYSTEM """You create simple, effective habit tracking systems and implementation tools.
   Focus on practical solutions that integrate with existing workflows."""
   ```

2. **Progress Monitoring Chains**
   ```bash
   mirador-ez chain "Create weekly review system for financial goals" financial_planning_expert master_coder
   ```
