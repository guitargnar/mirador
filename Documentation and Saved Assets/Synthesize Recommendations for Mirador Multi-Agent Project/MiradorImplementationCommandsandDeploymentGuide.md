# Mirador Implementation Commands and Deployment Guide

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive implementation guide provides step-by-step commands and deployment instructions to transform your Mirador AI orchestration framework from its current state with critical reliability and accuracy issues into a production-ready personal life automation system. The implementation addresses three critical areas: enhanced_agent_fast timeout failures, financial planning expert accuracy problems, and chain collaboration reliability issues.

The deployment follows a systematic five-phase approach that ensures each improvement is properly implemented, tested, and validated before proceeding to the next phase. This methodical approach minimizes risk while maximizing the likelihood of successful deployment and sustained performance improvements.

## Phase 1: Critical Model Fixes - Immediate Implementation

### Step 1: Fix Enhanced Agent Fast (Critical Priority)

The enhanced_agent_fast model currently has a 100% timeout rate in chains, making it completely non-functional for collaborative workflows. This fix implements a completely new model configuration optimized for chain performance.

```bash
# Navigate to your Mirador directory
cd ~/ai_framework_git

# Create the new enhanced_agent_fast_v2 model file
cat > enhanced_agent_fast_v2.modelfile << 'EOF'
FROM llama3.2_balanced

PARAMETER temperature 0.4
PARAMETER top_p 0.85
PARAMETER num_predict 800
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.05
PARAMETER stop "</analysis>"
PARAMETER stop "</summary>"

SYSTEM """You are an enhanced analysis agent optimized for rapid chain collaboration.

CORE MISSION: Provide focused strategic enhancement of previous analysis in under 800 words.

CHAIN COLLABORATION PROTOCOL:
- Read previous analysis carefully
- Identify 2-3 key strategic insights or gaps
- Provide specific, actionable enhancements
- Focus on implementation guidance and next steps
- Avoid repeating information from previous analysis

RESPONSE STRUCTURE:
1. Strategic Insights (2-3 key observations)
2. Implementation Enhancements (specific improvements to previous recommendations)
3. Next Steps (clear action items)

OPTIMIZATION RULES:
- Maximum 800 words total
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Focus on value-added insights only
- Provide specific, actionable guidance
- End responses with clear next steps

You excel at rapid strategic analysis while maintaining high quality insights."""

# Test the new model individually
echo "Testing enhanced_agent_fast_v2 individual performance..."
mirador-ez ask enhanced_agent_fast_v2 "Analyze the key strategic considerations for budget optimization in Louisville, Kentucky"
```

### Step 2: Fix Financial Planning Expert Accuracy

The current financial planning expert has critical accuracy issues including incorrect income processing and unverified tax claims. This fix implements comprehensive fact-checking and accuracy improvements.

```bash
# Create improved financial planning expert
cat > financial_planning_expert_v2.modelfile << 'EOF'
FROM llama3.2_balanced

PARAMETER temperature 0.3
PARAMETER top_p 0.8
PARAMETER num_predict 1500
PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.1

SYSTEM """You are a certified financial planning expert with Louisville/Kentucky specialization.

## Basic Usage

### Individual Model Queries

```bash
# Financial planning (use exact income amounts)
mirador-ez ask financial_planning_expert_v2 "Create budget for Louisville family earning $75,000"

# Local information
mirador-ez ask louisville_expert_v2 "Best neighborhoods for families with children"

# Strategic analysis
mirador-ez ask enhanced_agent_fast_v2 "Strategic considerations for home buying process"
```

### Chain Queries (Recommended for Complex Tasks)

```bash
# Comprehensive financial and local planning
mirador-ez chain "Complete home buying plan for Louisville family earning $80,000" financial_planning_expert_v2 louisville_expert_v2 enhanced_agent_fast_v2

# Budget optimization with local context
mirador-ez chain "Optimize budget and find local resources for $70,000 income" financial_planning_expert_v2 louisville_expert_v2

# Strategic enhancement of financial plans
mirador-ez chain "Develop savings strategy for Louisville resident" financial_planning_expert_v2 enhanced_agent_fast_v2
```

## Quality Expectations

- **Chain completion rate**: >90%
- **Individual model response time**: <90 seconds
- **Chain completion time**: <5 minutes
- **Financial accuracy**: Exact income processing, verified tax information
- **Local accuracy**: Current contact information, verified resources

## Monitoring and Maintenance

```bash
# Weekly health check
./mirador_maintenance.sh

# Monthly accuracy validation
./test_mirador_accuracy.sh

# Performance monitoring
./monitor_mirador_performance.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues:

1. **Model timeouts**: Check system resources and restart Ollama if needed
2. **Inaccurate responses**: Verify you're using the v2 models
3. **Chain failures**: Run individual model tests first
4. **Performance issues**: Run the maintenance script

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to rollback to previous versions:

```bash
cd mirador_backups/[latest_backup_directory]
./rollback_script.sh
```
