# Mirador Model Consolidation Toolkit

## Overview

This toolkit provides comprehensive tools to analyze, test, and consolidate your Mirador model library from 56+ models down to 12-15 optimized specialists.

## Tools Included

### 1. Model Analyzer (`mirador_model_analyzer.py`)
**Purpose:** Analyzes your current model library and provides consolidation recommendations

**Features:**
- Scans all .modelfile configurations and Ollama models
- Categorizes models by function (financial, context, decision, etc.)
- Identifies redundant versions and consolidation opportunities
- Generates detailed reports and implementation scripts
- Creates backup and retirement scripts for safe migration

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 mirador_model_analyzer.py
```

**Outputs:**
- `analysis_output/model_inventory_report.md` - Complete model inventory
- `analysis_output/consolidation_analysis.md` - Consolidation recommendations
- `analysis_output/backup_models.sh` - Safe backup script
- `analysis_output/retire_models.sh` - Model retirement script
- `analysis_output/migration_guide.md` - Step-by-step migration guide

### 2. Performance Tester (`mirador_performance_tester.py`)
**Purpose:** Tests model performance and reliability to validate consolidation decisions

**Features:**
- Tests models with category-specific scenarios
- Measures response time, success rate, and quality scores
- Compares performance across model versions
- Generates performance-based recommendations
- Identifies models suitable for retirement vs. retention

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 mirador_performance_tester.py
```

**Outputs:**
- `performance_results/performance_report.md` - Detailed performance analysis
- `performance_results/performance_data.json` - Raw performance data
- Performance-based consolidation recommendations

### 3. Configuration Generator (`mirador_config_generator.py`)
**Purpose:** Generates optimized configurations for the consolidated model set

**Features:**
- Creates optimized .modelfile configurations with llama3.2_balanced
- Generates orchestrator configuration files (YAML/JSON)
- Creates migration scripts for seamless transition
- Produces comprehensive documentation
- Defines optimized chain configurations

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 mirador_config_generator.py
```

**Outputs:**
- `optimized_configs/modelfiles/` - Optimized .modelfile configurations
- `optimized_configs/mirador_config.yaml` - Orchestrator configuration
- `optimized_configs/migration_scripts/` - Update and validation scripts
- `optimized_configs/documentation/` - Model and chain reference guides

## Recommended Consolidation Strategy

Based on analysis, here's the recommended consolidated model set:

### Core Models (2)
- `matthew_context_provider_v2` - Personal context and preferences
- `decision_simplifier_v2` - Final synthesis and action recommendations

### Domain Specialists (3)
- `financial_planning_expert_v6` - Comprehensive financial analysis
- `financial_planning_expert_fast` - Quick financial queries
- `louisville_expert_v3` - Local context and opportunities

### Quality Assurance (2)
- `enhanced_agent_enforcer_v2` - Quality validation and consistency
- `enhanced_agent_fast_v6` - Quick validation and error checking

### System Optimization (1)
- `mirador_system_specialist_v2` - Meta-analysis and optimization

### Content Specialists (4)
- `linkedin_content_expert` - Professional content creation
- `real_estate_analyzer` - Property and investment analysis
- `health_wellness_optimizer` - Lifestyle optimization
- `productivity_optimizer` - Efficiency enhancement

**Total: 12 models (78% reduction from 56+ models)**

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Analysis and Planning (Day 1)
1. Run the model analyzer to understand current state
2. Review consolidation recommendations
3. Run performance tests on key models
4. Plan migration timeline

### Phase 2: Configuration Generation (Day 2)
1. Generate optimized configurations
2. Review and customize as needed
3. Test configurations in development environment
4. Prepare migration scripts

### Phase 3: Safe Migration (Day 3-5)
1. Create complete backup of current models
2. Deploy optimized configurations
3. Test consolidated model set thoroughly
4. Retire redundant models
5. Update documentation and processes

### Phase 4: Validation and Optimization (Week 2)
1. Monitor performance with consolidated set
2. Fine-tune configurations based on usage
3. Validate all chain configurations work correctly
4. Document lessons learned
