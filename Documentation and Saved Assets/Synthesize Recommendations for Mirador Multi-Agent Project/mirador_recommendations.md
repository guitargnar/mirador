# üéØ Mirador Implementation Recommendations

## üöÄ Immediate Action Plan (Next 2 Hours)

### Step 1: Foundation Setup (30 minutes)
Execute these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Navigate and create project structure
cd ~
mkdir -p ai_framework_git/outputs
cd ai_framework_git

# 2. Verify Ollama is running
brew services restart ollama
sleep 10
ollama list

# 3. Install base models if missing
ollama pull llama3.2
ollama pull codellama
ollama pull mistral
```

### Step 2: Core System Installation (45 minutes)
```bash
# 1. Create main orchestration engine
# Copy the mirador.py code from the setup guide

# 2. Create the three specialist models
# Execute each modelfile creation and ollama create command

# 3. Install global launcher
# Create and install mirador-ez command

# 4. Create monitoring scripts
# Copy version_info.sh and test_performance.sh
```

### Step 3: Validation Testing (30 minutes)
```bash
# 1. System health check
./version_info.sh

# 2. Individual model tests
mirador-ez ask financial_planning_expert_v5 "Test query"
mirador-ez ask enhanced_agent_fast_v3 "Test analysis"
mirador-ez ask louisville_expert_v2 "Test local knowledge"

# 3. Chain execution test
mirador-ez chain "Test opportunity identification" financial_planning_expert_v5 enhanced_agent_fast_v3
```

### Step 4: First Real Analysis (15 minutes)
```bash
# Execute your first opportunity identification
mirador-ez chain "Identify immediate financial optimization opportunities" financial_planning_expert_v5 enhanced_agent_fast_v3

# Review results
cat outputs/chain_*/summary.md
```

## üéØ Strategic Usage Patterns

### **Daily Opportunity Scanning (5-10 minutes)**
```bash
# Morning opportunity check
mirador-ez ask financial_planning_expert_v5 "What financial optimization opportunities should I consider today?"

# Evening reflection
mirador-ez ask enhanced_agent_fast_v3 "Analyze today's decisions for optimization opportunities"
```

### **Weekly Deep Analysis (30-45 minutes)**
```bash
# Comprehensive financial review
mirador-ez chain "Weekly financial optimization and opportunity analysis" financial_planning_expert_v5 enhanced_agent_fast_v3

# Local resource discovery
mirador-ez chain "Identify new Louisville resources and opportunities" louisville_expert_v2 enhanced_agent_fast_v3
```

### **Major Decision Support (1-2 hours)**
```bash
# Real estate analysis
mirador-ez chain "Complete home buying strategy analysis" financial_planning_expert_v5 louisville_expert_v2 enhanced_agent_fast_v3

# Career transition planning
mirador-ez chain "Career change financial and strategic analysis" financial_planning_expert_v5 enhanced_agent_fast_v3

# Investment opportunity assessment
mirador-ez chain "Investment opportunity analysis with local context" financial_planning_expert_v5 louisville_expert_v2 enhanced_agent_fast_v3
```

## üîç Quality Assessment Framework

### **Content Evaluation Criteria**
1. **Specificity**: Are recommendations specific to Louisville/Kentucky?
2. **Actionability**: Can insights be implemented immediately?
3. **Quantification**: Are outcomes quantified with numbers/timelines?
4. **Integration**: Do models build upon each other effectively?
5. **Novelty**: Are opportunities identified that weren't obvious?

### **Performance Monitoring**
```bash
# Weekly performance check
./test_performance.sh > performance_log.txt

# Monthly analysis review
find outputs -name "summary.md" -newermt "30 days ago" -exec wc -w {} \;

# Track implementation outcomes
mkdir decisions_implemented
# Document which recommendations you act on
```

## üìà Optimization Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Financial Mastery (Week 1-2)**
Focus on financial opportunity identification:
- Daily budget optimization queries
- Weekly comprehensive financial analysis
- Track savings achieved through recommendations
- Refine prompts based on most valuable outputs

### **Phase 2: Local Integration (Week 3-4)**
Expand to Louisville-specific opportunities:
- Neighborhood analysis for various purposes
- Local service optimization
- Community resource utilization
- Local investment research

### **Phase 3: Strategic Integration (Week 5-8)**
Develop comprehensive life optimization:
- Multi-domain opportunity analysis
- Long-term strategic planning
- Decision framework development
- Outcome tracking and refinement

### **Phase 4: Advanced Automation (Month 2+)**
Build sophisticated analysis patterns:
- Custom model development for specific domains
- Automated analysis scheduling
- Integration with external data sources
- Community/network effect utilization

## üé™ High-Value Prompt Patterns

### **Opportunity Discovery**
```bash
"Identify overlooked opportunities in [DOMAIN] given [CONSTRAINTS]"
"What optimization opportunities exist in [CURRENT SITUATION]?"
"Analyze [SCENARIO] for hidden value creation potential"
```

### **Decision Support**
```bash
"Compare [OPTION A] vs [OPTION B] with Louisville context and financial implications"
"Create implementation roadmap for [DECISION] with risk mitigation"
"Analyze downstream effects of [DECISION] across life domains"
```

### **Resource Optimization**
```bash
"Map all Louisville resources relevant to [GOAL/NEED]"
"Optimize [CURRENT APPROACH] using local advantages and opportunities"
"Identify synergies between [RESOURCE A] and [RESOURCE B] in Louisville context"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### **Technical Pitfalls**
- Don't run chains when Ollama is not responding
- Don't expect instant responses - models need thinking time
- Don't ignore timeout errors - they indicate system issues
- Don't forget to check outputs directory for saved results

### **Usage Pitfalls**
- Don't use vague prompts - be specific about scenarios
- Don't ignore Louisville-specific context - it's a key differentiator
- Don't just read outputs - implement recommendations to validate value
- Don't use single models for complex decisions - chains provide better insights

### **Analysis Pitfalls**
- Don't assume all recommendations are immediately actionable
- Don't ignore risk considerations in opportunities
- Don't forget to validate financial assumptions with professionals
- Don't overlook implementation complexity in opportunity assessment

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Execute Setup Commands** (Use the complete setup guide)
2. **Validate System Performance** (Run all test commands)
3. **Start with Financial Analysis** (Highest ROI domain)
4. **Document Successful Patterns** (Build personal prompt library)
5. **Track Implementation Outcomes** (Validate system value)

## üé™ Advanced Opportunities

Once basic system is mastered:

- **Custom Model Development**: Create models for specific interests/domains
- **Integration Projects**: Connect with calendar, financial tools, local databases
- **Community Building**: Share successful patterns with other users
- **System Evolution**: Contribute to model improvement and capability expansion

Your Mirador system represents a sophisticated personal AI orchestra capable of identifying and analyzing opportunities that would require hours of manual research. The key to success is systematic implementation, regular usage, and continuous refinement based on real-world outcomes.

**Bottom Line:** This system can genuinely transform how you identify and evaluate opportunities across all aspects of personal life. The time investment in setup and learning will pay dividends through improved decision quality and time reclamation for higher-value activities.
