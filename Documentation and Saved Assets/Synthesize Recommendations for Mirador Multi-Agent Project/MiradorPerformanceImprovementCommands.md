## Step 5: Create All New Models
```bash
ollama create enhanced_agent_fast -f enhanced_agent_fast.modelfile
ollama create financial_planning_expert -f financial_planning_expert.modelfile
ollama create louisville_expert -f louisville_expert.modelfile
```

## Step 6: Test the New Models
```bash
# Test enhanced_agent_fast
mirador-ez ask enhanced_agent_fast "Analyze the benefits of meal planning for busy families"

Once these models are created and tested:

1. **Monitor chain performance** - Check if timeout issues are resolved
2. **Test real scenarios** - Use actual personal finance or local resource questions
3. **Iterate based on results** - Adjust model parameters if needed
4. **Expand to other domains** - Create specialists for health, parenting, home management
