2. **Logical Consistency**: Do the responses maintain internal logic?
3. **Creative Synthesis**: Can it meaningfully combine disparate domains?
4. **Technical Depth**: Does it provide expert-level details when needed?
5. **Practical Applicability**: Can wild ideas be grounded in implementation?
6. **Domain Flexibility**: How well does it handle unfamiliar territories?
7. **Coherent Speculation**: Are hypothetical scenarios well-reasoned?
8. **Cross-Model Synergy**: Do chains produce emergent insights?
