## Quick Reference Commands

### System Status and Health
```bash
# Check system status
./version_info.sh

# Verify all models
ollama list | grep -E "(enhanced_agent|financial_planning|louisville_expert)"

# Test basic functionality
mirador-ez ask financial_planning_expert_v5 "System test query"
```

### Essential Usage Patterns
```bash
# Individual model query
mirador-ez ask [model_name] "[your question]"

# Two-model chain
mirador-ez chain "[your request]" [model1] [model2]

# Three-model comprehensive analysis
mirador-ez chain "[your request]" financial_planning_expert_v5 louisville_expert_v2 enhanced_agent_fast_v3
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Test model performance
./test_model_performance.sh [model_name] "Performance test"

# Monitor chain execution time
time mirador-ez chain "[test request]" [model1] [model2]

# Review recent outputs
ls outputs/ | tail -10
```
