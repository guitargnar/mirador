       542 -  ```
       541    
       542 -  ### Decision Analysis Template
       543 -  ```
       544 -  "I need to decide between [option A] and [option B]. My priorities are [list priorities]. My constraints are [list constraints]. Help me make the best decision."
       545 -  ```
       542 +  ### Include Constraints
