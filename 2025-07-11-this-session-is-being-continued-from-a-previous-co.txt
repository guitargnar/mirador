⏺ Summary

  I've successfully completed TODO #12: Add GraphQL interface as alternative to REST. The implementation includes:

  Key Components Implemented:

  1. GraphQL Schema (src/api/graphql/schema.py):
    - Complete type definitions for all API objects
    - Queries for models, chains, sessions, webhooks, and cache statistics
    - Mutations for executing queries, managing sessions, webhooks, and cache
    - Subscriptions for real-time streaming
  2. GraphQL Views (src/api/graphql/views.py):
    - Flask blueprint with authentication integration
    - GraphQL endpoint with customized view class
    - WebSocket support for subscriptions
    - Playground endpoint for development
  3. Error Handling (src/api/graphql/errors.py):
    - GraphQL-specific error classes
    - Conversion from API errors to GraphQL errors
    - Consistent error formatting with extensions
  4. Middleware Stack (src/api/graphql/middleware.py):
    - Logging middleware for operation tracking
    - Metrics collection for monitoring
    - Caching with field-specific TTLs
    - Query depth limiting to prevent abuse
  5. Documentation (docs/api/GRAPHQL_GUIDE.md):
    - Comprehensive guide covering schema, queries, mutations, and subscriptions
    - Authentication instructions
    - WebSocket usage examples
    - Migration guide from REST
    - Best practices and performance considerations
  6. Examples (examples/graphql_queries.graphql):
    - Complete set of example queries, mutations, and subscriptions
    - Variable examples for each operation
    - Reusable fragments

  The GraphQL interface provides feature parity with the REST API while offering additional benefits like flexible queries, real-time subscriptions, and request batching. It integrates seamlessly with
   the existing authentication, rate limiting, and caching systems.
