   - `bin/mirador_universal_runner_v3_optimized.sh` - Chain runner (WORKING)
   - Smart query routing correctly identifies intent
   - Model chains execute successfully

2. **Models**
   - 15+ Mirador models already installed locally
   - Models respond correctly to queries
   - Chain orchestration functioning

3. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive README with animated visuals
   - Clear usage examples
   - Installation guides present

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found

1. **Missing Scripts**
   - `bin/mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh` referenced in docs but not present
   - Some examples reference non-existent paths

2. **API Module Issues**
   - Python import errors when testing API
   - Module path conflicts with local environment
   - API not immediately runnable without setup

### üìä Test Execution Results

### üéØ New User Experience

**Positive:**
- Main functionality works out of the box
- Smart routing is intuitive
- Output quality is high

**Needs Improvement:**
- Some documentation references outdated scripts
- API requires additional configuration
- Model installation process could be clearer

### üìù Recommendations

1. **For Documentation:**
   - Update script references to match actual files
   - Add troubleshooting section for common issues
   - Include API setup guide

2. **For Scripts:**
   - Add existence checks before calling other scripts
   - Provide helpful error messages
   - Include --help flags consistently

3. **For New Users:**
   - Start with `bin/mirador-smart-v2` for immediate results
   - Use v3 optimized runner for specific chains
   - Models work best when properly warmed up

## Conclusion

The core Mirador functionality is solid and delivers on its promises. The smart routing and model orchestration work well. Minor documentation updates and script fixes would improve the new user experience.
