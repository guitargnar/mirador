  You can now access these files from your GitHub repository at https://github.com/guitargnar/mirador

> It was supposed to be pushed to this repo: https://github.com/guitargnar/jcps-boots

⏺ I apologize for the confusion. The files were pushed to the wrong repository. Let me fix this by:

  1. First, removing the commit from the mirador repo
  2. Then pushing to the correct jcps-boots repository

⏺ Bash(git log --oneline -5)

⏺ Now let me check the remote repositories:

⏺ Bash(git remote -v)
  ⎿  origin	https://github.com/guitargnar/mirador.git (fetch
     origin	https://github.com/guitargnar/mirador.git (push)

⏺ I need to add the jcps-boots repository as a remote and push there:

⏺ Bash(git remote add jcps-boots https://github.com/guitargnar/jcps-boots.git)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Let me check if the jcps-boots repository exists and create a new directory for it:

⏺ Bash(cd /tmp && git clone https://github.com/guitargnar/jcps-boots.git)
  ⎿  Error: cd to '/tmp' was blocked. For security, Claude Code may only change directories to child directories of the allowed working directories for this session (including '/Users/matthewscott/Projects/mirador').

⏺ Let me create a separate directory for the jcps-boots project:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p /Users/matthewscott/Projects/jcps-boots && cd /Users/matthewscott/Projects/jcps-boots && git clone https://github.com/guitargnar/jcps-boots.git .)
  ⎿  Error: cd to '/Users/matthewscott/Projects/jcps-boots' was blocked. For security, Claude Code may only change directories to child directories of the allowed working directories for this session (including 
     '/Users/matthewscott/Projects/mirador').

⏺ I see. Let me work within the current directory structure. First, let me unstage the files and create a separate folder for the jcps-boots project:

⏺ Bash(git reset HEAD school_transfer_tracker_v2.py school_transfer_dashboard.py requirements_web.txt run_web_dashboard.sh README_school_tracker.md)
  ⎿  Unstaged changes after reset:
     M	.DS_Store

     … +1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p jcps-boots-files)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> It's already been created.

⏺ I understand. The jcps-boots repository already exists. Let me copy the school transfer tracker files to a new directory within the current working directory so we can properly push them to the jcps-boots repository:

⏺ Bash(mkdir -p jcps-boots && cp school_transfer_tracker_v2.py school_transfer_dashboard.py requirements_web.txt run_web_dashboard.sh README_school_tracker.md jcps-boo…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me initialize it as a git repository and push to jcps-boots:

⏺ Bash(cd jcps-boots && git init && git remote add origin https://github.com/guitargnar/jcps-boots.git)
  ⎿  Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/matthewscott/Projects/mirador/jcps-boots/.git/

⏺ Bash(cd jcps-boots && git add . && git commit -m "Add School Transfer Tracker with web dashboard…)
