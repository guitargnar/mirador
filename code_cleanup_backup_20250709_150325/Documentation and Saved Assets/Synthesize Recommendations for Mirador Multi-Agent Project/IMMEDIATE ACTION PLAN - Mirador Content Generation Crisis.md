# IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN - Mirador Content Generation Crisis

## 🚨 CRITICAL SITUATION SUMMARY

**Status**: CRITICAL SYSTEM FAILURE - Content generation completely broken
**Impact**: System executes but produces zero useful output
**Priority**: EMERGENCY - All optimization work must stop until resolved

## 📋 IMMEDIATE EXECUTION CHECKLIST

### Step 1: Run Content Generation Diagnostic (URGENT)
```bash
# Execute immediately to identify which models are functional
python3 mirador_content_diagnostic.py

# This will:
# - Test each critical model individually
# - Identify which models can generate content
# - Generate repair scripts for failed models
# - Create comprehensive diagnostic report
```

### Step 2: Run Chain Execution Debug (URGENT)
```bash
# Execute to understand chain-level failures
python3 mirador_chain_debugger.py

# This will:
# - Test chain execution patterns
# - Identify content flow issues
# - Generate simplified chain configurations
# - Analyze multi-model interactions
```

### Step 3: Execute Generated Repair Scripts
```bash
# After diagnostics complete, run generated repair scripts
cd content_diagnostic
./repair_content_generation.sh

# If models need rebuilding:
./rebuild_failed_models.sh

# Validate repairs:
./validate_content_generation.sh
```

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Minimum Viable Recovery
- [ ] At least 3 models generating content (>20 words per response)
- [ ] At least 1 complete chain producing final output
- [ ] enhanced_agent_enforcer working (currently only functional model)
- [ ] Basic financial planning capability restored

### Full Recovery Target
- [ ] All 6 critical models functional
- [ ] All test chains producing output
- [ ] Content generation success rate >80%
- [ ] Chain execution working end-to-end

## 🔧 DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS PROVIDED

### 1. Content Generation Diagnostic (`mirador_content_diagnostic.py`)
**Purpose**: Test individual model content generation
**Output**: 
- Detailed model functionality report
- Repair scripts for failed models
- Configuration analysis for broken models

### 2. Chain Execution Debugger (`mirador_chain_debugger.py`)
**Purpose**: Analyze chain execution and content flow
**Output**:
- Chain-by-chain execution analysis
- Content flow breakdown identification
- Simplified chain configurations using working models

### 3. Automated Repair Scripts (Generated by diagnostics)
**Purpose**: Fix identified issues automatically
**Includes**:
- Model configuration repair
- Model rebuilding procedures
- Validation testing

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

### DO NOT PROCEED WITH PHASE 2 UNTIL RECOVERY COMPLETE
- Base model migration will worsen the situation
- Optimization work is meaningless without content generation
- Must restore basic functionality first

### DO NOT ATTEMPT MANUAL FIXES WITHOUT DIAGNOSTICS
- Run diagnostic tools first to understand the scope
- Manual fixes could compound the problem
- Systematic approach is essential for recovery

### BACKUP BEFORE ANY REPAIR ATTEMPTS
- Current broken state is still recoverable
- Repair attempts could make situation worse
- Maintain rollback capability throughout recovery

## 📊 EXPECTED TIMELINE

### Day 1: Emergency Diagnostic
- **Morning**: Run both diagnostic tools (30 minutes)
- **Afternoon**: Analyze results and plan repair approach
- **Evening**: Begin repair script execution

### Day 2: Systematic Repair
- **Morning**: Execute repair scripts and validate results
- **Afternoon**: Test individual models and simple chains
- **Evening**: Assess recovery progress

### Day 3: Validation and Stabilization
- **Morning**: Comprehensive testing of restored functionality
- **Afternoon**: Document lessons learned and implement monitoring
- **Evening**: Declare recovery complete or plan additional actions

## 🎯 RECOVERY VALIDATION COMMANDS

### Test Individual Models
```bash
# Test each critical model manually
ollama run matthew_context_provider "Provide context about Matthew's situation"
ollama run financial_planning_expert_v6 "Create a basic budget framework"
ollama run enhanced_agent_enforcer "Review: Louisville is in Kentucky"
ollama run decision_simplifier "Summarize: save vs invest options"
```

### Test Simple Chains
```bash
# Test with mirador-ez if available
mirador-ez chain "Basic financial question" enhanced_agent_enforcer

# Test two-model chain if both models work
mirador-ez chain "Financial planning question" financial_planning_expert_v6 enhanced_agent_enforcer
```

## 📈 RECOVERY SUCCESS INDICATORS

### Immediate Success (Day 1)
- Diagnostic tools complete without errors
- At least 1 model producing >50 words per response
- Clear identification of root cause

### Short-term Success (Day 2)
- At least 3 models functional
- Simple chains producing output
- Repair scripts showing positive results

### Complete Success (Day 3)
- All critical models functional
- Complex chains working end-to-end
- System ready for optimization work

## 🚀 POST-RECOVERY NEXT STEPS

### Only After Complete Recovery
1. **Re-run Phase 1 performance testing** to establish new baseline
2. **Validate Phase 2 readiness** using readiness validator
3. **Proceed with base model migration** only if all checks pass
4. **Implement monitoring** to prevent similar failures

### Monitoring Implementation
- Regular execution of diagnostic tools
- Automated content generation testing
- Performance trend monitoring
- Early warning system for degradation

## 📞 ESCALATION CRITERIA

### Escalate if:
- Diagnostic tools fail to complete
- No models can be restored to functionality
- Repair scripts cause further degradation
- Recovery timeline exceeds 3 days

### Escalation Actions:
- Consider complete system rebuild from scratch
- Evaluate alternative AI orchestration platforms
- Implement manual workarounds for critical functions
- Engage external technical support

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT ACTION

**RUN THIS COMMAND NOW:**
```bash
python3 mirador_content_diagnostic.py
```

This will provide immediate assessment of the situation and generate specific repair guidance. Do not proceed with any other actions until this diagnostic completes and you understand the scope of the problem.

**The content generation failure is a CRITICAL emergency that must be resolved before any other work can proceed.**
