# Claude Integration Security Assessment

## Executive Summary
This document outlines the security considerations and best practices for integrating Claude into the Mirador AI Framework.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- API key management and rotation policies
- User authentication mechanisms
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data retention policies
- PII handling procedures

### Network Security
- API endpoint security
- Rate limiting implementation
- DDoS protection measures

## Threat Model

### Identified Risks
1. **API Key Exposure**
   - Risk Level: High
   - Mitigation: Environment variables, key vault integration

2. **Data Leakage**
   - Risk Level: Medium
   - Mitigation: Input/output filtering, data classification

3. **Prompt Injection**
   - Risk Level: Medium
   - Mitigation: Input validation, output sanitization

### Security Controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output filtering for sensitive information
- Audit logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Privacy
- GDPR compliance measures
- CCPA requirements
- Data minimization principles

### Industry Standards
- SOC 2 compliance
- ISO 27001 alignment
- NIST framework adherence

## Security Best Practices

### Development
1. Secure coding practices
2. Code review requirements
3. Dependency scanning
4. Security testing integration

### Operations
1. Monitoring and alerting
2. Incident response procedures
3. Regular security audits
4. Backup and recovery plans

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Configure API key management
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up audit logging
- [ ] Configure data encryption
- [ ] Establish monitoring alerts
- [ ] Create incident response plan
- [ ] Document security procedures
- [ ] Train development team

## Recommendations

1. **Short-term (0-3 months)**
   - Implement basic security controls
   - Establish monitoring baseline
   - Document security procedures

2. **Medium-term (3-6 months)**
   - Enhance threat detection
   - Automate security testing
   - Conduct security audit

3. **Long-term (6-12 months)**
   - Achieve compliance certifications
   - Implement advanced threat protection
   - Establish security metrics dashboard
