## üìã COPY-PASTE REALITY

These aren't theoretical. These are the actual problems you face daily.

Each command generates real solutions based on:
- Your context at Humana
- The restrictions you navigate
- The politics you manage
- The goals you pursue

**Run them. Use the outputs. Make change happen.**

Because that's what Mirador is really about - empowering associates to solve their own problems, despite the system, not because of it.

*"Every pain point is an opportunity. Every restriction is a chance to innovate. Every command above proves it."*
