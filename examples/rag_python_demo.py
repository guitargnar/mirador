Subject: Re: Enterprise License Proposal

Thanks for the proposal. A few concerns:
1. The $50k/year seems high compared to competitors
2. We need SSO integration by Q2
3. Can you guarantee 99.9% uptime?

From: sales@ourcompany.com
To: client@bigcorp.com

I understand your concerns. Let me address each:
1. Our pricing includes premium support and custom features
2. SSO is on our roadmap for Q1 release
3. We currently maintain 99.95% uptime with SLA

Would you be open to a pilot program at a reduced rate?
