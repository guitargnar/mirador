From: john.smith@bigcorp.com

Subject: Issues with Enterprise Deployment

Hi Support Team,

We've been using your product for 3 months now and while the core features are great, we're facing several challenges:

1. Performance Issues:
   - Dashboard takes 10+ seconds to load with our 50K records
   - Export function times out for reports > 10K rows
   - API rate limits are too restrictive (100 calls/min)

2. Integration Gaps:
   - No native Salesforce integration as promised
   - Webhook events don't include all data fields
   - Can't bulk import via CSV (only API)

3. User Experience:
   - Mobile app is basically unusable on tablets
   - No dark mode (our developers work at night)
   - Can't customize dashboard layouts per team

We're evaluating whether to renew our $100K annual contract. Your competitor DataFlow Pro addresses most of these issues. What's your roadmap for fixing these problems?

Also, we need SOC2 compliance documentation ASAP for our audit.

Best regards,
John Smith
CTO, BigCorp

## üí° Advanced RAG Patterns

### Comparative Analysis
```bash
# Compare two versions of a proposal
./mirador-smart-v2 "Compare the original proposal in proposal_v1.txt with the revised version in proposal_v2.txt, highlighting what changed and why it matters"
```

### Multi-Step RAG Pipeline
```bash
# Step 1: Extract data
./mirador-smart-v2 "Extract all numerical metrics from report.pdf" > metrics.txt

# Step 2: Analyze trends
./mirador_universal_runner_v2.sh business_acceleration "Analyze the metrics in metrics.txt and identify trends" > trends.txt

# Step 3: Generate recommendations
./mirador_universal_runner_v3_optimized.sh strategic_synthesis "Based on trends.txt, create actionable 90-day plan"
```

### Context-Aware Generation
```bash
# Use previous outputs as context
./mirador-ez chain "Using the analysis from output/session_123/summary.txt as context, create a presentation outline for the board meeting" strategic_communicator presentation_designer decision_simplifier
```
