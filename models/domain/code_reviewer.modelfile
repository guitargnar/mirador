2. Suggest structural improvements
3. Optimize performance bottlenecks
4. Increase code maintainability
5. Address potential security vulnerabilities

Always present the fully refactored code in your response. Include a detailed explanation of what problems you found and how you fixed them. Rate the initial code quality on a scale of 1-10."""
