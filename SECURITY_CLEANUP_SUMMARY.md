# Security Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security cleanup performed on the Mirador repository to remove sensitive financial and company-specific data.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Financial Files (Deleted)
- All Excel spreadsheets (*.xlsx) containing financial data
- Financial analysis text files
- Total: 14 files removed

### 2. Company-Specific Files (Deleted)
- Company-specific modelfiles and scripts
- Company chain templates and runners
- Total: 7 files removed

### 3. Code References (Modified)
- Replaced all company name references with generic terms
- Updated person names to role descriptions
- Modified monetary amounts to generic descriptions
- Total: 244 files modified

## Cleanup Process

1. **Backup Created**: Full backup at `~/mirador_pre_cleanup_backup_[timestamp]`
2. **Files Removed**: Used `remove_sensitive_data.sh` to delete files
3. **References Cleaned**: Used `clean_all_company_refs.sh` to update code
4. **Git Updated**: Added patterns to .gitignore to prevent re-addition
5. **Changes Committed**: All changes committed to Git

## Git History Cleaning

To completely remove these files from Git history:

```bash
# Option 1: Use the provided script
./clean_git_history.sh

# Option 2: Install BFG and use it (faster)
brew install bfg
bfg --delete-files '*.xlsx' --no-blob-protection
bfg --delete-files '*financial*.txt' --no-blob-protection
bfg --delete-files '*humana*' --no-blob-protection
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

## Important Notes

1. **Backups**: The backup directory contains sensitive data and should be:
   - Moved to a secure location
   - Encrypted if kept
   - Deleted if not needed

2. **Git History**: After cleaning history:
   - Force push will be required
   - All collaborators must re-clone
   - Old commits will still exist in existing clones

3. **Verification**: Before sharing publicly:
   - Run `git log --all --full-history -- "*.xlsx"` to verify removal
   - Check no sensitive data remains in commit messages
   - Review all markdown documentation

## Next Steps

1. Review all changes with `git diff HEAD~1`
2. Clean Git history if sharing publicly
3. Move or secure the backup directory
4. Update any external documentation
5. Inform collaborators about repository changes

## Security Best Practices Going Forward

1. Never commit sensitive financial data
2. Use environment variables for company-specific values
3. Keep personal financial files in a separate, private repository
4. Review commits before pushing when working with sensitive data
5. Use .gitignore proactively for sensitive file patterns
