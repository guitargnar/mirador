To create your AI-driven music composition tool, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Research**: Understand how different musicians compose their chord progressions within a specific style or genre. This will help in training the model effectively.

2. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather datasets of music from your target artists, ensuring you have permission to use them if necessary. You'll need cleaned data that represents typical progression patterns for each artistâ€™ endorsement or usage rights are secured beforehand. 

3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract features relevant to chord progressions such as key signatures, time signatures, and

You're on the right track! Building an AI-powered music composition tool is a fascinating project. Let's dive deeper into each step, adding more nuance and insights:

**1. Research & Understanding Musical Style:**

* **Beyond Chord Progressions**: While chord progressions are crucial, don't solely focus on them. Explore the artist's melodic structures, rhythmic patterns, instrumentation choices, and even lyrical themes. These elements contribute to the overall "style" that your AI should capture.
* **Subgenres & Evolution**:  Music genres often have subgenres with distinct characteristics. If you target a specific subgenre (e.g., indie pop vs. mainstream pop), your research needs to be even more precise. Also, consider the artist's evolution over time â€“ their style might have changed throughout their career.
* **Qualitative Analysis**:  Supplement your quantitative data analysis (like analyzing chord frequencies) with qualitative listening sessions. Identify recurring musical motifs, unique transitions, and emotional nuances that define the artist's sound.

**2. Data Collection & Preparation:**

* **Copyright Considerations**: You are absolutely right about securing usage rights!  
    * **Public Domain Music**: Explore using music in the public domain as a starting point. 
    * **Creative Commons**: Look for music licensed under Creative Commons (CC) that allows for adaptation and commercial use, but always check the specific terms.
    * **Original Composition**: Creating your own

Building an AI-powered music composition tool sounds like an exciting project! With your background in Python and basic music theory, you're off to a great start. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

**Step 1: Define your goals and scope**

* Identify the type of artists you want to model (e.g., pop, rock, jazz). This will influence the style of chord progressions generated.
* Decide on the level of complexity and uniqueness you want to achieve in the generated chord progressions.
* Consider the desired output format: MIDI files, sheet music, or audio files.

**Step 2: Gather and prepare data**

* Collect a dataset of chord progressions from your target artists. You can use online resources like:
	+ MusicTheory.net (has a large collection of chord progressions in various styles)
	+ Chordify (generate chord progressions for any song)
	+ Online forums and communities (e.g., Reddit's WeAreTheMusicMakers)
* Label and annotate the dataset with relevant information, such as:
	+ Artist
	+ Song title
	+ Key signature
	+ Time signature
	+ Tempo
	+ Chord types (major, minor, seventh, etc.)

**Step 3: Choose libraries and frameworks**

* **Music theory and analysis:**
	+ `music21` (a powerful Python library for music theory and analysis)
	+ `Mido` (a lightweight library for working with MIDI files)
* **Machine learning and neural networks:**
	+ `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` (deep learning frameworks with pre-built modules for music processing)
	+ `Keras` (a high-level neural network API that runs on top of TensorFlow or PyTorch)
* **Data preparation and preprocessing:**
	+ `Pandas` (for data manipulation and analysis)
	+ `NumPy` (for numerical computations)

**Step 4: Develop your AI model**

* **Architecture:** Design a neural network architecture that takes into account the music theory concepts you want to capture. Some ideas:
	+ **Chord embedding layer:** Represent chord progressions as dense vectors using techniques like Word2Vec or Chord2Vec.
	+ **Melody and harmony generators:** Use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to generate melodies and harmonies based on the input chord progression.
* **Training
