To create your AI-driven music composition tool, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Research**: Understand how different artists compose their chord progressions within the style of interest. This will help in training a model that can mimic those styles effectively.

2. **Data Collection and Preparation**: Gather as many examples of music from your target artist(s) to use for training purposes. You'll need clean, labeled data indicating which chords are used together by the artists in question. Tools like Music2Melody or Chordify can help extract this information if needed.

3. **Choose a Model**: Select an

Let's dive deeper into building your AI-powered music composition tool.  

**1. Research: Beyond the Surface**

* **Style Analysis:** Simply understanding chord progressions isn't enough. Analyze the rhythm, melody, instrumentation, and even lyrical themes that define the artist's style. This holistic view will inform your model's output beyond just chords.
* **Identify Common Patterns & Variations:**  Look for recurring motifs, harmonic structures (like the "I-V-vi-IV" progression), and how artists deviate from these patterns to create unique flavor.
* **Target Subgenres:** If you focus on a specific subgenre within an artist's work, your model can be even more specialized and accurate.

**2. Data Collection & Preparation:  Quality Over Quantity**

* **Curate Carefully:** Don't just grab every song the artist has ever released. Select tracks that best represent the style you want to emulate. Consider different eras or albums for a richer dataset.
* **Labeling Accuracy is Crucial:**  Use tools like Music2Melody or Chordify, but double-check their output. Manually refine labels for complex sections or ambiguous chords. 
* **Data Aug

Building an AI-powered music composition tool sounds like an exciting project! Given your background in Python and basic music theory, you're off to a great start. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you get started:

**Step 1: Research and Data Collection**

1. Study the chord progressions of your target artists:
	* Listen to their songs and analyze the chord progressions used in each song.
	* Take note of the specific chords, chord voicings, and progressions used.
2. Collect and label data:
	* Gather a large dataset of chord progressions from your target artists' music.
	* Use tools like Music2Melody or Chordify to extract chord information from sheet music or audio files.
	* Label each progression with relevant metadata, such as the artist, song title, and genre.

**Step 2: Choose a Machine Learning Approach**

1. Consider using a **Neural Network**, specifically a **Sequence-to-Sequence** model, which can learn patterns in chord progressions.
2. Alternatively, use **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are well-suited for modeling sequential data.

**Step 3: Select Relevant Libraries**

1. **Music21**: A Python library for music theory and analysis. It provides tools for parsing and analyzing musical scores, as well as generating chord progressions.
2. **Mido**: A Python library for working with MIDI files. You can use it to generate MIDI files with your AI-generated chord progressions.
3. **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**: Popular deep learning frameworks that you can use to implement your chosen machine learning approach.

**Step 4: Implement the Model**

1. **Create a dataset**: Use Music21 or Mido to create a dataset of labeled chord progressions.
2. **Implement the model**: Choose a library (e.g., PyTorch or TensorFlow) and implement your neural network or RNN architecture. Train the model on your labeled dataset.
3. **Test and refine**: Test your model on a separate dataset and refine it as needed to improve its performance.

**Step 5: Integrate with a User Interface**

1. **Choose a GUI library**: Select a library like Tkinter, PyQt, or wxPython to create a user-friendly interface for your tool.
2. **Design the UI**: Create an interface that
